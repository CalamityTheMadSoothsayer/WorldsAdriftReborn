        "Grandpapa blowed a hole in the flame. He said I must try to sleep. But I was scared and I couldn't, not with the great purple howl, and the shuffling of the beetles, and the endless night, and the din of the children swimming above and around us.\n\"Our new home will prevail. We have all we need. Just have to hold out young 'un, and wait for the storm to end.\"\n\"Tell me a story,\" I said.\n\"It's time for sleep,\" he said. I folded my arms crossly, and he knew I'd not let up until he gave me a story.\n\"Oh alright.\"\n\"The one about the armies!\"\n\"Ah, yes.\"\nThen he put his arm around me, and knelt beside my splintery bed.",
        "\"The year was 2743.  It was a promising age, when the stone first came to us.  This concerns your great great great great great great great great Uncle Sloop.  By all accounts he had a thin and measly head of hair, which he liked to conceal beneath a leafy hat.  He lived in the autumn hills of Karem, just up from the first bend of the river, where the water breaks white and violent at the weir.  Where the river Karem rakes across the valley, and thins up towards the Pintins in the north.\"\n\"But Grandpa they aren't there any more.\"\n\"Hush!  They are, in my mind's eye.  Anyway, your Uncle Sloop had no job, but roamed the foothills, living off the land.  But the winters were hard, so he'd come down off the slopes into Karem to seek work.  One year, there were murmurings of war, both sides wanting the Atlas in the Kioki mountains.  Lucky for Uncle, the army was conscripting, so he joined up.  He was a fine shot, and he knew the slopes as good as any.  He was at one with nature, see, but the other men couldn't stand him.  Sloop always worked best alone.\"\n\"Once the barber had taken his unruly beard down to a fine bristle, they set him off with a scout's provisions, up into the forest, where he would be most at home.  He hiked upstream, where the river narrows enough to cross.\n\"It was there he spied the Pinnish camps, their ponchos and fur hats dotting the far shore.  It was by his rapid return and advice, that the entire Karem brigade appeared opposite two days later.  They made themselves known on the lower bank, patrolling proudly under the Karem flag.  At their hip were pistols, and at their feet cannons dragged by mules.\"",
        "\"The Pin trained their weapons upon the adversary across the narrow gulch. The order from their side was to wait. Hands twitched on triggers. Cannons were jiggled and primed..\nIt was your Uncle Sloop that cause it. He had a strange sense of humour, and at the moment when all were most expectant as to what the other might do, he stood upon a rock, put his hands to his mouth and made the sound of a gun with his cheeks.\nA wide-eyed Pinnish soldier responded wildly. He lit his cannon fuse, and its aim being unrehearsed, blasted the ball across the gully and into a tall tree. The tree teetered before falling a distance from the men beneath.\"\n\"What happened next?\"\n\"Well, since all but the silly soldier knew it was Sloop upon the rock who made the noise, a bout of laughter began to echo around the gully, and soon both sides were hysterical. Since none were hurt, no harm was done. Both sides conversed by means of bellowing across the roar of the wier, and agreed they should make peace that day, and resume fighting on the morrow.\nBut there was to be no fighting, since the Empress of Ishgiru, having heard of the dispute, resolved to form the Unity by which the three states of Karem, Ishgiru and Pin would then be known.\"\n\"So, my Uncle Sloop brought the peace?\"\n\"Yes he did, in his own sort of way.\""

So lay your weary head down, close your eyes, and listen to my words.\nImagine yourself floating, up and up like a skyship, until you are face-to-face with the big moon. Then big moon kises you on the cheeck (kiss your child now).\nThen imagine a green garden with boughs of fruit red and gold. Then a kind Pilipus, who weaves peacefully there upon a chair. Then you know that many gifts are yours to have and command, since you are chosen, little one. You are god. You are god.\nThen you float up once more, float up again like the greatest skyship, until you are face-to-face with the big moon. Biug moon kisses you up on the cheek (kiss your child again).",

You are god.\nThen you float up once more, float up again like the greatest skyship, until you are face-to-face with the big moon. Then big moon kisses you on the cheek (kiss your child again).\nThen imagine a stark place, of old blood and death. And from the grey soil beneath the ashen peaks, Alkabar rises, with his phantasmal legion behind him. \u00a0His skull is broken and distorted from the armoured heel that stove in his face. Yet it is you who stands guard before him, knowing that you are god, and they are merely mortal. Unwavering, you feel a surge of power fulminate within you., and then ecstasy, as a great bloom of sunlight tears out. It slices through Alkabar's blackened bones.\nThe moment he crumbles to dust, his army crumbles to dust.\nThen you float up for the final time, a hero of Sabor. The bosom of Aetherium welcomes you, and you join the collected. You can see all across your kingdom, from Redusa to the Studded Desert and beyond. You see all your people, the corn harvest and all your animals. You hear every conversation, see every thought. You are god, you will all decide what's right. You are god, We are god."

      "A Curious Arraignment": [
        "\"You are here,\" said the court clerk, \"in the presence of the Mercantile Authority of Ten-Rui, and so the scrutiny of the Kioki Unity. We are present the Warlock of Metal to conduct proceedings.\"\nBeneath the noble benches is the public viewing gallery, and below that, an intricate wooden rood screen. The Warlock of Metal jangles in from behind it. He is robed, and wears the ceremonial helm of the Mercantile Authority - a downy 'coonskin topped with an oversized replica of a coin.\n\"The charges brought against you are very serious,\" says Metal, stepping into the chalk circle, specially constructed for the assizes. He removes a copper coin from his moneybag, dips it into candle wax, then rolls it along a wooden floorboard. The jury and the gallery watch its journey, gasping as it loses speed, begins to wibble-wobble, and finally ripples flat. Metal steps out of the circle, and walks the length of the room. He peers over the object like a heron, and happy with the outcome, returns the coin to his pocket.",
        "\"Tell me sir...\" he says, so loudly, that even the backbenchers are awoken from their slumber.\n\"...which member of the Mercantile Authority allowed you to trade in precious stones? If he or she is in this room, point to him now.\"\nThe accused, who is dressed entirely in saffron yellow, points sheepishly to the Nabob Vulio, who grimaces back at him.\nNabob Vulio?\" says Metal with faux surprise, \"a man of status and bearing. Surely Nabob you impugn this claim?\"\n\"I do, and I don't,\" replies the cadaverous Vulio.\nThere are whispers of \"shame!\" and \"accomplice!\" from the gallery, but they fall quickly silent when Metal draws himself up, and to restore order, holds out the fronds of his gown. He looks at the fleabitten crowd with contempt.\nCome now, do you really think the Nabob would bring this case to court himself, if he were guilty in any of its aspects? No, the Nabob announces the facts only out of honesty.\"The Nabob looks pleased with himself as Metal continues, Something tells me there is more to the matter, which your innocent involvement will shortly reveal. Did you, Nabob, or did you not, grant this man a trader's licence?\"",
        "\"I did,\" says Vulio.\n\"Because he made fitting contribution to your company and its subsidiaries?\"\n\"He did.\"\n\"And what terms were agreed?\"\n\"It was agreed that this man, would be licensed to purvey Atlas to the Court of the Empress.\"\n\"Ah!\" says Metal, pointing upwards in understanding, \"and I presume, exclusively Atlas?\"\n\"That's right, your eminence,\" says Vulio smugly.\n\"Bring forth the witness.\"\nA shrew-like girl appears from behind the rood.  She has fine and dainty hands, and is clearly in the employ of the Empress as a handmaiden.\n\"Dear girl, do you recognize this man, and how?\"\n\"I do.  He is the aforementioned purveyor of Atlas, who latterly brought us emeralds and rubies of fine quality, at a very decent price,\" she said, more sweetly than perhaps befit the circumstances.\nAt this point, the accused, who feels the walls closing in, takes it upon himself to shortcut his cross-examination.\n\"So bloody what?! I sold some stones cheaper than someone else.  What am I s'posed to do when me mine runs dry of greenstone?\"\nThere is jeering and laughter in the gallery, and even the nobility in the tier above titter at the audacity of the fellow.  Metal smiles, and bows, and applause reigns all around, but for the accused, who the sparrow guards chaperone outside.  He kicks and fights all the way to the door.",
        "\"So, jurors, the verdict is clear, what of the sentence?\"\nThe six jurors all wear Empress green.  Their faces are solemn and veiled.  Their spokeswoman scratches the verdict on the clay slate, and hands it to the sparrow guard, who in turn passes it to Metal.\n\"Interesting,\" he says, looking perturbed, \"they have elected to vote for leniency.\"\nThere is a groan from the gallery.\n\"For this senseless crime, he will be exiled from the Unity forthwith.  All his possessions, currency and assets are to be kept safe by the Mercantile Authority.  He will be taken by skyship to a place of marooning, and left to live out his days despised and alone.\"\nThere is a final hurrah from the gallery, and then the court clerk summons the next victim."

      "A History of Sabor": [
        "The History of Sabor until the 4th Millennium.  By Meulen Beek, of Redusa.\nChapter 5.  How We Became Gods.\nBy the 16th Century, Sabor had largely overcome internal divisions, and was beginning its path to enlightenment.  This was a society that cared for everyone, ensuring as a people, they fulfilled a potential that was obvious from the very beginning.  What once was a lowly collection of disparate cities that had allowed themselves to be bullied by Bandinia, was entering a new era, in which they would come to define the perfect society.  One only has to consider the sun-drenched earth in which the early Saborians found themselves to realize their existence was no coincidence.  Sabor was born divine.\nBut understanding came gradual.  It was some time in the 1500s that the Saborians finally began to bloom.  Shrines grew in number along the river Redu, and ritual flourished.  Many now viewed life only as a beginning.  Life was a test of resolve and prowess ahead of the Aetherium.  A commentator of the time is Lady Pyrrhanes;\nLady Pyrrhanes' Scroll, c. 1547\n\"And the stones were washed, time and again.  Death forsook those at the rising place, for death no longer held sway.  Each man and woman were bequeathed from the first god, whose lineage is pure.  Thusly, all can grow to be god by communing with the stones to reach Aetherium.\"",
        "Such a discovery must have weighed heavy on the minds of the citizens, as it still does even today. It is a hard life, when you must leave all behind in search of your ascent to god, as a writer, Lalo, remarks in 1788;\n\"I have been mistreated by many women, for my skinny looks. I have had no success in the Boros, and find myself at the Cloistrum, trying to match the other men. As for other aspects of ascent, they shall have to wait, for otherwise there will be no time in the day when I am able to write.\"",
        "Lalo's exact commitments as a writer are not known.  but by this time, a system of job division was already in place.  Stonemasons and carpenters would, for example, exchange places for large parts of their careers.  Generally exchanges only took place between similar \"classes\" of jobs.  While these may seem relatively minor allowances, it anticipates the mid-third century, some seven-hundred years later, in which the most famous such story emerges;\nAlquin Hue, 8th of the Gallish month Srib, in the year 2507.\n\"At first the news was terrible, but it quickly became wonderful.  The people of Agbana had elected a mayor.  But this mayor had formerly been an athlete!  Not from a noble family, or a university education.  No, instead an athlete.  \"Why not,\" they said.  Why not indeed!\"\nAnd so it continued.  Equality became the essence of Saborianism: \"We are all gods, and must help each other reach Aetherium.\"\nIt was not until much later that the Rising Place was fully understood.  Yet the Gallish \"discovery\" of Atlas in the late 27th century presupposes that no other peoples knew of the stones until that moment, which is simply not the case.  There was no need for us to make crude examinations of the stone with which we already held a deep bond.",
        "By the 2750s, construction of the Stalk in Redusa, and other famous enlightening landmarks, like the Grey Bridge in Momoros, was well underway, with many Citizens having the honour of being contributors. Some help from the Pilipia was recompensed in food and good living. The best of them were even awarded citizenship.\nOnce the Stalk had been built, it created a focus for Saborian life and self-warship. Citizens flocked to see it from the other cities, though they would be asked to return home within the month.\nWhat was probably most intriguing about the Stalk, was how well god manifested itself in the upper part of the disk. The wings of apotheon seemed impossibly precarious, with it's two freestanding towers of perfect white.",
        "Thus the Golden Age began in Sabor, and peace reigned, as it still does approaching the third millennium. Part of the reason for this security, is the view taken towards outsiders, as our incumbent Premiuer Einkornus recently stated;\n\"We may look at their (Other nations of Foundation) best ideas, and make them our own. But we shall never lose what it is to be Saborian.\"\nIn particular there have always been trouble with two peoples. The brutes to the south, known as the Bandini, and the interferences of the Verdubans. Regarding the Verdubans, a scholar commenting as long ago as 2300 said;\n\"If they were worth an invasion, it'd have happened by now, because they properly deserve it.\"\nAs for the Bandini, what more can be said that hasn't already. They have been a menace since the very first Saborians were forced to defend our rightful home, and have a selfish madness that seems inherent in their race, loving money and other such barbarities.\n<The rest of this book is lost>"

        "A most extraordinary sight. That is to say, the Tarrery, marching full of life beyond round stone dwellings surrounded by stick fences, out into a terrible blizzard. How cold it is, where the warm sea does't lap. But they are resolute, because they have one another. Their long whaling spears wobble in their hands as the clamber into skyrafts - former seafaring vessels, that now use Atlas. They are able to rise and fall upon the whales they hunt at their leisure.\n\"Life is easier now,\" said one, in a voice alternating between gruff and shrill, \"but ours are still the old ways.\"\nOf course he means that they never kill a whale for sport, nor the sacred white wolf neither. But if the must make a kill, then they offer gentle thoughts to the animal, and ask for forgiveness from the spirits in the moments before the spear is thrown. They waste no part of the creature, since in such a barren expanse, they must make use of anything and everything."

Of course, this amounts to nothing really, in a larger sense. Therefore, I can't agree with Panyana's views, and would reckon that if not entirely flat, Foundation is the shape of a curved scale, like those found on the little armoured ones with tails. Or perhaps like a kite that billows somewhat with air. As I have said before, the likelihood is that beyond the perimeter of cartography (as it stands) is an endless expanse of ocean, since this is what has been reported by those that have lived to tell the tale.\nBefore I bow out, I'd like to thank my students, and hope that the closure of Redusa is not as imminent as it seems."

Once the snakehead had agreed, he said he knew where to find the Queen of the Shamoe, who was only half-human.\nThe summit would be held in the mown grove of cottonwood, where the valley of flowers sweeps steeply from the bluebird's shrine, which follows from the stack of white stones that the snakes infest, then follows to the webs of the spider-women, down again, into the cinder-yard and then claypits, and up old smoke hill to the edge of Capulca, where the sea is first seen.  Then down the long street of Capulca to my house.",

She had been hidden in the rock somehow. She looked like a wise and beautiful panther, and it felt as if we'd known her all our lives.\n\"Why did you bring us here?\" she brooded, for \u00a0the Shamoe dislike making themselves known.\n\"I have an important matter to discuss,\" I said.",
        "We waited for a day for Tally-Tee of the Snakemen to arrive, while we told stories of snakes and the other animals, and fed on snake hearts Mal-Er had brought.\nTally Tee himself could not stand to see us eat a snake.\nWhen he arrived the next morning, I finally brought the matter that weighed heavy on me to summit.\n\"All our ways are different, and we must promise not to squabble, even if you Tally-Tee, wish to live among the snakes, and you Mal-Er wish to kill them. We shall not speak of this meeting with anyone, by the spirit Meth, who gave us this summit stone.\"\n\"We accept your terms,\" swore the four before me. The Snakemen had fought the Intucki many times, since they were so far apart in understanding, but neither would defy a law sworn upon the spirit stone.",
        "\"Do what you will Ah-Nut, it cannot affect us. If the northerners want to take my land, let him attack, and die by fire,\" said Mal-Er of the Intucki swishing his torch around him, still looking for the snake. He was less at home here than on his beaches. His tribe built their sandforts there, and trapped the snakes between fire and the sea.\n\"Stupid Intucki,\" said slender Queen of the Shamoe, Gri-Liif, \"not all people are brutes.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"Gri-Liif is right. The money-men will not come in daylight with sticks and beat in your door, they will creep slowly in at night like the tide, until all the house is flooded, and you are flushed out clinging onto your last good plank.\"\n\"But they can do nothing while Hatep rules Koinos,\" said Tally-Tee. He looked up to the stormclouds for a glimpse of Hatep's tail, and we saw the full save of his serpent mask. \"They can do nothing when we have the snake.\"\n\"That is why I have summoned you here,\" I said gravely, \"Since we have found a cure against it's poison.\"",
        "\"How many people know of this cure?\" said Srit-Taka.\n\"Myself, and three nurses at Capulca.\"\n\"Are they Pekoe?\"\n\"Yes, all are Pekoe.\"\n\"Not Bandians with the sickness, escaped to hide their faces?\"\nI raised my three fingers to say \"no\".\n\"Not Gallish soul-sellers then?\" said Gri-Liif.\n\"What do you know of Gall?\" scoffed Mal-Er.\n\"More than you, less than most.  They say Gall will sell any secret for the right price.\"",
        "We spent several days beside the rock, and we frolicked in the streams. Mal-Er caught us river fish, and we lay awake at night pondering right and wrong. The stars gave us no sign, and we knew we must each decide for ourselves.\nFinally the day arrived. Those voting for spreading word of a cure would mark the stone with a circle. Those voting against with a cross. Each would cover their mark with a broad leaf. When all had marked the stone, the leaves would be removed and the vote counted. Each would then make the case for their mark, so that the matter was closed in their minds.",
        "The vote was as follows;\nMe XGri-Liif XMal-Er OSrit-Taka OTally-Tee X\nAnd so it was decided that the cure would be hushed. Once I had burned our findings, myself and the others must undergo the memory ritual - an experience so painful it would clear our minds of what we knew, or prevent us from speaking of it.\nThe summit now explained their vote.\n\"My people have no need of the cure,\" said Tally-Tee of the snakemen.\n\"I feel sad for the children who die of the bite, but I respect this brave decision,\" said Srit-Taka of the Tamoe.\n\"You are all standing in the way of progress. If we have it, why not use it? We could keep it a secret among ourselves!\" said Mal-Er of Intucki, but it was too late for that now.\n\"These lands are sacred. Those that come to exploit, they are who would benefit most, not us, who have always lived beside the snake,\" said Gri-Liif.\nI raised five fingers for \"yes\", as I thought Queen Gri-Liif of the Shamoe spoke true. I removed my mask of medicine, for it was not in keeping for the lie we would now swear upon.\n\"Then we are agreed. I am with you Gri-Liif. If they do not fear Koinos, they will come here in their thousands, looking for Atlas, and there will be nothing we can do to stop them.\u201c"

        "The Saborians got to us first.\nRecords show we were impressed at the level of understanding achieved by Redusa University, who believe it or not, were our peers in research back in 2740. We had many exchanges, but our knowledge of Atlas trumped theirs, and the first deal was made.\n\nOf course then the Unity knocked at our door, since the Warlocks had heard of our agreement with Sabor. They had scientists too, but no formal institutions, and grew to rely upon us. We knew they'd reward us well, and we exploited that knowledge.\nThe returns for 2998 show that the income from Unity projects was more than twice that of the Saborian ones. We were greedy, and we kept both. We didn't think about the outcome.\nThis is a formal apology to all of Gall, on behalf of the Liaison Trustees. Gu-Do has been sentenced, which given what lies ahead for the rest of us, may seem more a reprieve. The sentence shall be resolved privately, by self-issue. She will not have a state funeral.\nThe best advice we can offer, is to stay at home and spend time with your loved ones. Pray to the gods if you think it well help.\nBlowwom Wilts, of the Liasion Trustees, 3038."

        "For many years the Fasio pistol club offered me salvation. I had the chance to perfect my shooting, and meet good friends along the way.\nThings at the club had recently become awkward, the new president wasn't Chabutian but Mellifluan, and seemed to want to reform the club into something wishy-washy. She was threatening to ban using live ammunition for goodness' sake! It was a good time to get away, and I think the situation prompted Gup's outburst.\nGup wasn't a good friend, but had been ally at the club. He was from Verduba. Everyone knows Verdubans are nice people, but Gup wasn't, and that's why i liked him. In fact, he seemed to hate Verdubans.\n\"We're so obliging and charitable. If only we could help ourselves instead, and stop meddling in other people's business.\"\nI thought he might be referring to the recent incidents involving Vinicotian cannibals.\n\"I want to go somewhere and shoot moving targets,\" he said, \"if we go far enough away, no-one from the club'll find out.\"\n\"A few Goatbears?\" I said with a nervous laugh. I hoped had not been having darker thoughts.\n\"Yeah, why not?\" he said, to my relief.\nWe went up and set our rudder east.\nGoatbears, well, I didn't believe they were real. Whatever we found, I hoped it was really unique, like the tusked head of a boar. Perhaps it would be so impressive when we got it back to the club, they'd give us the presidency, and things could get back to normal.\nThe last thing I expected was to be fighting for our lives in the dark.",
        "We had a few disagreements on the way to Pin, and things came head to head.\n\"What are we doing? Goatbears aren't even real. Let's find something else to shoot.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I don't know like a herdsman or something.\"\nI was appropriately horrified, and began to steer the ship back around.\n\"What are you doing?\" he said angrily.\n\"Taking us back.\"\n\"We've come this far, you're not turning us back.\"\n\"I'm taking us back,\" I repeated, at which point he flung himself toward the helm, and tried to wrest the controls from my grasp.\nBefore long, we were in a tangle on the floor, grappling and punching wildly at one another. The ship began to plunge downward like a humpback whale. The air around us drew closer until it was murky, and all that could be seen above was the faint imprint of the egg-grey sun.\nI kept swinging at his face and hitting, but they were weak efforts. He saved up his swings, but caught me hard.\nSo it continued, until we were both exhausted. The ship was terminally out of control, and we were helpless to stop it.",
        "It creaked, lurched and juddered, and then a great roar followed, as it tore through what I though was a rock face. Great clods of earth drummed on the hull, and we put our hands above our heads for protection. Finally the noise stopped,  and the engines cut out. In the gloom I could only see the whites of Gup's eyes.\n\"Where are we?\"\n\"Truce?\" he said.\n\"If you want,\" I said.\nAfter a few moments I saw a flicker on the periphery of the crash site. Whispering noises. Then movement. A shot rang out. Gup had fired.\n\"What are you doing!? I said, but he fired again. Whilst he was reloading, I saw one of the creatures come straight for us, then dart behind a boulder. They were gigantic ants, running upright on two legs. Gup hit one, and it flinched but the pistol shot ricocheted harmlessly off its carapace. There were more of them, all getting closer. I said, \"Gup, I'm leaving,\" but he wasn't listening, he was having too much fun. I ran and ran, and didn't look back until I reached a low rise.\nThe last I saw of Gup, the giant ants were swarming over his body, thrusting their lance-like arms into his sides.",
        "My legs were caked in mud, and I was bleeding. I found a haven, a wall of dried out mud under that arced up like the crest of a wave. Ahead an aqueduct of teetered, since our ship had made a hole in it. This must have been the source of the ants consternation - if indeed they were angry at all, Gup had never given them a choice. How fascinating it might have been to converse with them, They were fearsome,, but walked on two legs much like us, and built structures much like our own.\nI knew now that this was the Night Lands, where the heavy clouds rule. Barren mudflats. It has plentiful water, but little light and little growth.\nAfter three days, I managed to get to the western coast, and to my amazement saw an unbroken line of blue sky beyond.\nThe brown sand was as frigid as the water. I made a fire, and clung on to the hope that someone might pass by. I unstrapped the gun and fired it at a nearby concon, whose white milk exploded. Then I made a hole in the sand, and buried the smithers of concon and my gun together, vowing never to touch so terrifying a weapon again."

There was a layer of Atlas dust over everything, and tarpaulins over that. Mother was ill, and she collected junk. Father was ill too, and insisted we keep it all. I tried tossing the really useless stuff overboard at night, but they noticed. I can see father's ruddy face now, his heavy hand juddering down upon me.\nThe only thing they couldn't keep hold of was their children. When we stopped in the Wahsili desert, and the parents scurried to gather the old shuttle springs and limpet gauges that were drowning in the sand, Marinello hid. Una, our dog, decided to follow. I watched them go, but didn't say a word to the parents when they'd returned. I knew this was Marinello's chance. It was only when we'd taken off and left the Wahsili that they realised my brother was gone.\n\"Where's t'other?\"\n\"What?\"\n\"T'other boy. You thrown him off too?\"\n\"No mother, not I.\"\n\"We need 'im,\" father said, and he thumped me.",

I remember as we squised down to land, the green sludgewater hugged the bow up to the poop deck, washing thickly over it. The parents scurried off carrying their looting sticks, looking for something divine.\nI ripped off my dirty clothes, and dove into the swamp water. It was cold. I swam a mile, and hid among the roots. I chewed pieces of mangrove. It tasted how I imagined medicine. I lay on a slab of rock to dry and fell asleep. When I awoke, I saw the Coral Dew was gone. Both Marinello and I were finally free!",

It turned out, he didn't know too much Saborian after all.\n\"and Bandini?\" he said, \"do you not have a language?\"\n\"It was lost...\"\n\"Oh. Terrible,\" he said.\n\"...but a wise-woman kept it. She told her daughter. Then her daughter told her daughter's daughter. Now many of us keep it in our hearts, and mutter it under our breath.\"\nMorray put his hands on his knees, and lifted himself up. He was broad, but not tall. In one movement, he took our bowls, danced with his wife, then spun out the door. He poured the food scraps on the grass outside, and the pig trotted over and suckled at the patch. The pig was coated in a chemise of bright green algae.",
        "Morray returned to his chair, and became lost in thought. I stared at the planked floor, it was rickety, and I could see the marshwater beneath us through the joins.\n\"What of the troubles?\" he said gravely.\n\"I don't know, sir\" I said, \"we've always been afloat. It's often what's saved us from trouble.\"\n\"Aye,\" he said, leaning back on his stool and folding his arms, \"it is easy to lose track of the world if you are always afloat. One should come down to earth once in awhile. If you forget what you come from, you lose what you are.\"\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\n\"We weren't always in the clouds, but born from the mud like pigs.\"\nHe nodded to the pig, who snuffled around the frame of the door.\n\"I heard pigs like clean water, sir.\"\n\"Clever lad, you're right.\" He smiled and scratched his rubbery nose.",
        "\"What do you think of Sabor?\"\n\"I hate Sabor, and they hate us,\" I said.\n\"Your words?\"\n\"That's what mother said, sir.\"\n\"As simple as that, eh? Yes I suppose it is. Your mother left you here in the Great Marshas?\"\n\"I left myself here.\"\nI smiled proudly at the thought.\n\"Well, I shan't ask further,\" he said with more sadness than I felt myself. \"you seem alright considereing. Mari, bring us some Shnockel.\"\nMari tutted tenderly. She took a beaker from the larder by the scruffly stair, and proudly poured the Shnockel into two small glasses. When I brought it to my lips I could smell it burn.\n\"Good sponging,\" Morray barked cheerfully. I drank, then I wiped my eyes dry on my arm. Mari brought me water to wash away the prickle in my throat.",

It was raining lightly, and a hiss came from the water.\nA squat gown was ready aboce the door. I took it and put it on. I sensed some working arragement was all but in place for me. At morning supper, Morray was eating his spit-roasted leapers.\n\"They're better cold,\" he said.\n\"I'm sure, sir,\" I said.\n\"Azrudin, there's no cause to 'sir' me, as if I were Saborian. In the Marsha all are equal. Once you have helped Mari in the kitchen, and with suds in the washtub, you may rest. Then we can hear your stories.

        "Two months of darkness had been horrible. The acid, the undulation of the muscles beneath us. Luckily I still had my lighter. \nI unfolded the map of Melliflua\n\"Won't be needing this anymore,\" I said to Alika, but he wasn't listening.\nI pulled away the cord that edged the map, then snipped an inch-long piece of it with the knife, putting the remainder away for later.\nI held up my lighter. At one end of the stomach was another chamber I remembered from school as the duodenal ampulia. A steady drip oozed from a vesivle on the wall. I slopped over and held the mess tin under it. Once a little of the ooze had cooled and solidified in the tin, I pushed the small piece of cord into its middle and stood it on end. Then I left the tin to fill to the brim.\nI had to conserve the lighter's fuel. So I slopped back to Alika in the dark, feeling for the rectangle of tarpaulin on which he lay, my satchel, his belt, his warm back. I could smell his blubber-breath.\n\"Fancy having all this junk in your belly.\" I said. I knelt and stroked his head. His beard was long and soft. \"Does it still hurt?\"\nI felt for the gash where his leg had snagged on the tooth. The bandage would need changing soon, and we didn't have anything left.",
        "\"Surge!\"\nWe felt the beast push upward. Now was the chance. We sidestepped the pit of stomach acid and the coagulated nests of half-digested prey, and grappling with the loose skin of the stomach wall, we made the ascent to the oesophageal slit.\nThe beast tilted suddenly, as if it were driving. Alika slipped for a moment, but I caught him and held him long enough that he could recover his grip.\n\"Is it diving back into the Hole?\"\nWe waited, then suddenly the beast surged upward again. We climbed on until we reached a platform of muscle, and the slit.\n\"Me first,\" I said.\n\"Be quick, you know the drill,\" he said.\nI steeled myself, then as we had practised, dive headfirst through the gap. It was a clean dive. There was a phonic roar from aboce, but nothing more. I wriggled up the narrow tract as fast as I could, Alika just behind me. The creature roared all the while, and we were drenched in secretions from the walls.",
        "\"This time, we don't touch the tongue,\" he said. The incident with his leg flashed by and I winced.\n\"If we get that far,\" I said.\nClaustrophobia. We had to get out. One mistake and we'd be crushed in the gullet, or vomited into the void. We'd thought about inducing a vomit, believe me - but what if we shot out, and found nothing out there? What if we just fell forever?\nSafer to stay here, but this was no life for anyone.\nThe longer the crawl takes, the more it irritates the creature. Even for seasoned stomach-dwellers it was unpleasant, but we went as quick as we could.\n\"The tongue begins,\" I said. A faint light suffused the oval as far as the lips on the opposite side. We were careful to avoid standing on the tongue, instead clinging to the outer wall of the mouth. All I wanted was to see the mouth open, just for a moment. To see a white hope beyond.\n\"Keep concentrating,\" yelled Alika, \"those teeth are sharp.\"\nHis leg was in a bad way, but he was doing the best he could. If we failed now. It'd have to come off, and we had nothing to cut it off with.\n\"There are a lot more teeth that I remember.\"\n\"The trouble is getting over to the far side without using the tongue.\"\nThen in happened, the jar opened and a great flood of cold air rushed in. And light! After so long, light!",
        "Before I could cover my eyes, there was a heavy jolt and we were knocked to the back of the mouth. The jaw bounced up and down, up and down. The teeth chattered together, and pieces of beetle carapace flew back towards us.\n\"That's what happened last time,\" shouted Alika, \"sooner or later the tongue's going to catch us, and we'll be back down with the beetles.\"\n\"Alright, alright, just hold on tight!\"\nThe tongue started slapping up against the palate, and the bits of beetle slid one-by-one down the chute beneath us. Just when I thought I'd lost my strength, the jaw stopped. We dropped down on the tongue, and lay out on our backs for a moment, exhausted.\n\"Phew.\"\n\"That was a close thing.\"\nA darkness so familiar now. I flicked my lighter, barely a dribble of fuel in the cylinder. The doors of the creature's mouth were firmly closed. I let my head fall back down. I shone it above me, and saw a little hole. What hole was that?\n\"The trachea! If we climb up we can leave by the blowhole.\"\n\"But it's too narrow, it won't be able to breathe.\"\n'That's what I'm counting on.\" I said.",
        "The wheezing came as soon as we'd wedged ourselves in. We lay as falt as we could to the trachea so that air could still flow.\nNow, \"jam into the blowhole\" I said. And we did, squeezing ourselves up into the upright shaft. I felt water on my face, a fresh mist from outside. We were so close.\nThunk. Thunk. THUNK.\nWe shot up the blow hole at highspeed, volleyed up into the open air. I felt my stomach lurch as we went up, but could see nothing through the dredge of mucous covering my face.\n\"Wahh,\" I heard Alika scream.\nWe landed on the great beast's back with a soft thud. We clung to the rough tessellations of its skin, and wiped the gunk from out eyes. All around us clouds, the sun! The Hole was changed. It had retreated below and formed a thunderous cloud-bed.\n\"What bliss! Saved by this majestic beauty,\" said Alika, patting the creature's back.",
        "A phonic roar rose from the blowhole. \"We are the children!\" it sounded like.\n\"These children must love to play here now,\" I said.\n\"Children?\" said Alika.\n\"These beasts. They play here now.\"\nWe saw others in the distance rising and falling between tiny islands, each a world adrift. Of Foundation the are but fragments of memory preserving something, anything, of what we were.\n\"Now dearest, how do we get off this thing?\""

        "Next month will be the occasion of his hundredth birthday, which he'll celebrate like every other birthday - working solidly in his kitchen. But to every Saborian, this must surely be a reminder of his contradiction. He is twice the age of any other citizen, yet he is afforded the same privileges.\nThe trouble is, no-one can imagine life without him - he has no understudies, no competition. His knowledge and craft only seems to improve with age, and not only is he perfectly capable of looking after himself (as we are so often told the elderly cannot), he works harder than everyone else, and produces better results. While his un-Saborian attitudes are well-documented, in particular his love of other cuisines, he has taught Sabor to love these dishes more than their own.",

        "\n\nFrom the original Mellifluan, part of a new volume called, \"Stories to cheer us up.\"\n\"The worst people are convinced that what they see, is what we must all be seeing. If however, you start seeing things no-one else does, you're likely just mad.\"\nThat's a proverb I've spent most of my life trying to disprove.\nI am not an inventor and I am not a scientist, though lately I am beginning to wonder. Principally I have been an artist, and a lover of fruit wine. I have lived a life of dishevelment, but I have my uses; as a drum for my friends to beat me for example. I told them to stop - the sounds my body made when hit with hands and sticks weren't interesting enough for them to carry on - but it turned out they wanted my money and booze. Bottoms to them. I'm in a better place now, living beside the sead, watching the birds breaking their bum-eggs over horrified tourists. I don't belong here either, but at least it's nice.\nAnyway, what I wanted to write about was how much I've enjoyed living, and how I thought I might die soon. Of belly-rot, or by my friends finding me and beating me so hard my head comes off. But before all that, I have a contribution to make. Artists everywhere will love me for it, women will love me for it.\nI have found a new colour, and I'm going to call it \"breen\". Wonderful breen!",
        "Breen is a colour I discovered after a very long night.  It was four in the morning, maybe five, and I had missed the last skyship home, but I was happy to stretch out for forty winks on the platform of the skyway.  I was pleased to find it cleaner there, and less refuse-strewn, than the floor of my apartment.  I was tipsy too, that helped.  I'd sold a painting, and I'd spent the proceeds as if it were my last night on Foundation.  The money was completely gone on wine, and as the sun began to rise, my venter felt ready to vent.  As I lay on my side, desperately hoping to recover.  I looked across the platform and into the dawn cloud.  It was there that I saw it; a new colour.\nI may be naughty, but I never lie.  I saw what I saw, don't tell me I didn't.\nI haven't seen breen since.  I tried to mix it of course - I tried for months.  But there's nothing in my paint tin like it.  I remember the week after that glorious night, finally waking up from my nightmares.  I kneaded a figure eight of bread, and turned on the radio.  An old song came on and it made me think of my lost loves.  Not loaves, loves.  All thirty-six of 'em.  I had some fruit wine.  Then I took the bread out of the oven, but it was too soon, and the inside was raw.  I threw it in the bin, and the whole process somehow reminded me of breen.  I was lucky, if the bread hadn't gone bad I might have forgotten breen. Wonderful breen!",
        "So I think it was around the time I belched in the copper kettle, and an echo rattled around the copper tubes blowing the nightguards eardrums, that I was finally evicted from the factory.  The guard and I are still on good terms, so it's fine.  I just can't have any more of their wine.  I've moved on to the Gariet factory now, and I can tell you that their wine drinks like pig slurry, but that their security is negligible.\nObviously, I hoped the factory was my ticket back to the land of breen.  I even tried drinking until four or five in the morning, lying out on the same skyway platform at what I thought was the same angle.  But I just couldn't quite remember what that colour was like!  It was off the musical scale, it tasted salty and prickly like a sandal thing, but at the same time not.  It felt like desiccated goldfish to the touch, but dreary and  aimless too, you know?\nI decided I needed to be more practical.  I am so useless about practical.  I can't even remember where I get my paints from.  Then one day there was a big party.  I didn't have a paper invite as such, but I heard the noise.  I went to complain, but the music and the company were wonderful, so I stayed.  Then I got talking to this man about my new colour, breen.  Celery-face was wearing an aquaponics suit, and I'm not sure whether it was hired for the party, or for some genuine undertaking.

        "I thought he was joking, but his face seemed grave. I don't know why, but tears came to my eyes. He sat down across the axle of his deckchair, and looked out to sea. I turned and sobbed, trudging my way slowly back up the beach. I was hoping he'd call for me to wait, but he didn't. The sand felt so ho , but the world and its people so cold.\nThen, a lifeline, a tap on the shoulder and I spun 'round, thinking it would be Scatch, but instead it was his lady-friend.\n\"It's my fault,\" she said, \"please don't cry. I never wanted anyone to cry.\" Then she herself began to weep.\n\"You don't believe him do you? You don't believe in breen,\" I said, and by now, we were both in tears. Hers seemed just as earnest as mine, I checked.\n\"I don't...know,\" she said, looking back at Scatch, whose solemn vigil over the waves was unbreakable.\n\"Don't worry,\" I said, \"don't worry about me, look after you. That's the important thing. Look after Scatch, he needs you now.\nI'm pretty sure I said some other good stuff that sounded right too. I got out of the sun as quick as I could and off\n or a good glug of fruit wine.\nSomething must have happened, because a week (I think it was) later, Scatch came around to my accommodations, and we spent a pleasant evening talking about breen. He said the lady had decided to move on, but that he didn't mind. He said breen was more important, and that he couldn't let me feel like I was searching alone.\nSometimes we are destined for things. Wonderful breen!",
        "I remained unconvinced. That night at the skyship station, when I came back to myself, I was sure that if I ever saw breen again I'd know it immediately. This rock in Scatch's hand gave me a more uncertain feeling, as if the colour of the stone were the wrong word, when the right one was on the tip of my tongue.\n\"I don't know,\" I said again, less sure, \"perhaps it is close to this, but not quite. I mean, isn't this more green than breen?\"\nScatch looked at the stone again for a few moments, before lowering his weedy celery arm to his side, and closing a white-knuckled fist around it.\n\"Oh Benoit, what do we do if this isn't breen?\"\nHis voice wavered. His yellow-green face, normally so buoyant, had plummeted through the clouds.\n\"Don't fret Scatch. We are looking for breen, but we may never find it. That's the beauty you see, the discovery itself is the byplay, the journey the main event.\"\n\"No!\" said Scatch, who was shaking now.\n\"We can't seek answers where we can't be sure an answer exists.\"\n\"NO BENOIT! NO! All we ever do is seek breen, that's all I am anymore. I cannot... I cannot!\"\nScatch unwound his arm and let loose the pebble of Atlas across the studio. It skimmed though my tin of paints, dispersing indigo and vermillion as if a bullet rupturing the hide of a beast, before bursting through a neat hole in the window pane.",

There was a clatter of silver trays and foodstuffs, and appalled noises from the other passengers.\n\"Get off me devil's wind!\"\nThat guttural blare could only be Hamesh. I bubbled with anticipation, but had to remain calm. I looked around casually, and to my exhilaration, saw the old master. He was even bigger than I remember him, and as sweet as ever in addressing the hapless waiter, whose cutleries lay spangled across the foot-lit deck.\n\"If you touch me again lad, I'll touch you. Very firmly in the Ogballs.\"\nThe waiter knocked aside, Hamesh came striding towards the viewing glass, looking out on Foundation and muttering angrily under his breath. I watched, and waited for the prime moment.\nI imagined the Bellowes must have thought his appointment a coup - they offer him passage to whichever port he desires, and in return his mere presence makes the cruise a sell-out. But how they would then come to regret it; caging themselves in with the beast, watching powerless as he shreds the furniture, and knocks the stuffing out of the crew. Setting trepidation aside, I reached up to the giant and tapped him on the shoulder."

        "Foreward (To a biography of Zubin)\nMy time has come, and I wanted a few words committed to paper. The rest of this volume has been faithfully and expertly accounted by Gartias in her own style, but this foreward is mine.\nMany desire to be Utopianist. It is my honour and good fortune to have held that position, and I thank Aetherium for steering me that far, But every victory and defeat beyond the moment I first placed my hat on the hatstand, is solely down to me.\nMany candidates, on becoming Utopianist, are quickly forced to resign. The pressure is there from the moment you walk in the door, regardless of how long you spend dreaming and preparing for it, or how much knowledge you possess ahead of the task. What role required is hard work, and even then, my advice for anyone wishing to try it out for size, is that hard work may not be enough.\nBut... as long as you have conscience, you can succeed - as some say I did. Though naturally, I think there are a million things I could have done better.",
        "Take the matter of the rising age. If the law did not exist, I imagine a citizen might live a hundred or more years. Under the ruling, perfect balance exists. My regret is that agreeing the practice took too long, and the door was left open to question when it should have been shut.\nSuffice to say, it went (forgive me) beyond faith.\nAt its heart, the motion was a form of population control, at a time my \"conscience\" began to surface. I knew that if Redusa or Momoros ever grew too big, the bubble would burst, the earth would shift, and our towers would crumble. We had to be grateful for what we had, take nothing for granted.\nIt remains my belief that humility and modesty are the foundations of godliness. We accept that in exchange for a life that is short and sweet, we must not outstay our welcome.\nSpare now a thought for the Pilipai, whose lives are seldom well-lived. Yes, they may live long, but the concessions of a non-citizen are many, and there will be no place for them in Aetherium come the end. It is for them as much as us, that our cities must remain small. This is our perfect symbiosis.",
        "And what of genius, men and women who might only improve with age? Was it hard to see them go, or to exile them to the lands of the Pilipai when they refused to put down the brush? Of course it was. But their bitterness shall never undermine their achievements.\nHow can we prevent such unique knowledge being thrown to the wind? By bringing those of rising age into education during their final years, so that their knowledge can be transferred. I myself have been seconded to the assembly, teaching the young thinkers all I know. Besides, Aetherium guides us, the voices of the risen. Each age flows seamlessly from one to the next.\nOn a final note, it is with great delight I see my ecological legacy continues. Our gardens of delight burst with colour in spring, and the sweet aroma of the flowers is what living is all about. The Pilipai keep the river clean, and the grandest new city constructions are made in the aspect of nature, barren and bounteous as she may be. My work on this is my proudest achievement.

Furthermore, I noted that it seemed to be holding together, in spite of everything.\nThis really only confirms the paper I unveiled at the Efflua symposium, nearly ten years ago. Back then, findings demonstrated that Koinos was stable, and experiencing prolonged tectonic intervals. This was hard to understand given measurements everywhere else in Foundation, which were off the charts.\nWe knew it was connected to Atlas, but time ran out on the project. Time ran out on all of us. My theory on the cause of his variation, remains speculative.

They leave no footprint. They put as much in as they take out. Here, there are no cities, no skyways, no mines. It wasn't quarried raw.

        "I don't know how long it had been going on, by then. But when I first spotted the small huddle of workers at the southwest corner of the Darat camp, at the blind spot where the bending palms obscure a kink in the fence, I froze.\nFor some reason I didn't sound the alarm. I lust watched. I waited to see who, or what was drawing them here. I recognised the shrivelled pot-bellied Tepes. one of the Goners, and some others. I could have sworn they were talking with someone beyond the fence.\nA colleague appeared from the elevator to relieve me of duty. I knew if he saw what I saw, he'd report me. I distracted him with card talk, and when I next snuck a glance at the kink in the tense. I saw that the Bandinians had returned to the exercise yard",
        "I went down to the mess room, and picked up a hot vittles, and guilty bowl of corn. Guilty, because every time I lifted the spoon to my mouth, I thought how much more others needed it. Those slaves at the fence. That's probably what they were doing there, but who was giving them food?\nI went to command, and I said, \"Commander, I really like the view from South Tower, I'd like to continue duty there, if possible. The bracing desert wind brings me closer to god.\"He grunted. I had invoked an old promise that barely held any sway these days.\"If you must,\" he said, \"speak to the dutyman.\"As I closed the door to his office, I heard the radio warble to life, and his feet prop up on a chair.",
        "It was early morning, a good hour before dawn. I yawned. It had been a dull night's watch. As always I'd kept my eyes on the kink in the fence, waiting for something.\nThen I saw him. Pale Fox. An apparition catching the lens of my binoculars. The outline of a being, hunched, his face strangely crooked.\nThe figure was so still, that after some time I began to doubt if it was anything more than moonshadou. But as the first ray of sunlight arced over the land, the grainy figure stood prouder against the sand, I could see his feral mask.\nSuddenly he twitched, and for a few moments stared straight at me. Then he shot away into the scrubland.",
        "After that he grew balder. He came to the fence at Quiet times, when he knee there was no-one else on duty but me.\nWe observed one another curiously. He must have wondered what I'd let him get away with, how far he\u2018d be allowed to go before I betrayed him.\nI noticed he had stopped meeting the slaves to give them food, and it wasn't hard to guess he had something more ambitious planned.\nOne night, he went north of the kink in the fence to another spot, not far from the western gate. As he slipped between the perimeter fence and theback of the storehouse, he turned been to look at me. I pointed to my eyes, than towards the western watchtower, to let him know they would be watching. Then I sliced under my neck to imply it would be dangerous.He paused, nodded, and darted on.\nI was complicit in it now. I was a traitor.",
        "I knew it would begin not long after the start of my\n\nshift. There were more than usual in the exercise yard as\nI looked out across the camp, and to the left where the\nkink in the fence was, Pale fox stood stock still. I felt\n\n\njust as nervous as him.\nHe locked to me, and gave me a countdown on one hand. At zero, I called the inspector at Nest Gate.\n\"Oh hello Inspector, it's South Gate watchtower here.\"\n\"Yes?\"\nI gulped.\n\u201cThe commander wants to see you in his office.\u201d\n\"Really? What, now?\u201c\n\"Yes, he said right away. We are god.\u201c\nI watched him step out of the booth and wander back along the line to West gate, he put his angel into the machine, and the barrier rose. He pointed his gun at the nearby slaves, who backed away. Then the gate lowered behind him. For a moment I worried he could shortcut through the back section where Pale Fox was waiting. but he took the longer, more established route.\nThe escapees wouldn't have long.",
        "At my signal, Pale Fox dashed off into the scrub, then I saw him return at speed through the tunnel to the booth, where he whipped a spare angel key and jammed it into the gate machine.\nHe looked at me again.\n\"West Tower, this is South Tower. The commander is on his way over. He wants those surveys.\"\n\"Thanks South Tower.\"\nI swung my binoculars to West Tower. The guard was in the elevator, heading to the archive. I raised and lowered my arm quickly. Pale Fox began ushering the Bandinians out through the gap between he fence and the storehouse. They only had to run across open ground for a few feet before they got to the gate.\n\"Hey, who are you signalling to?\" shouted the inspector, who was standing outside the commander's office. When I didn't reply, he ran inside. I waved frantically at Pale Fox, and he drove the slaves out at greater speed.\n\"Sound the alarm!\" cried the commander, putting his mantle over his shoulders, and looking up to my tower in disgust."

The expression of Agonon is said to embody creation, preservation and destruction, which are so central to Mellifluan belief. While some admire Muldoon's interpretation of the story (the best-known regarding the centipede god), many resent the cheap idolatry the sculpture invokes. They argue that Muldoon (literally) placed Agonon upon a pedestal, when his adultery is the last thing that should be celebrated.

The Verduban cause c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre here is the lifestyle of the Vinicotian cannibals, who at the time it was painted, had grown increasingly feverous at the sight of Verduban ships. This was largely because they say embroidered images of body parts on the saisl of passing Verduban ships, and took it to be an omen of their deliciousness.\nFollowing a number of incidents, the Verdubans wanted a guarantee of safe passage through the strait, and send a negotiator to Vinicoti who was well versed in island dialects. The story goes that receiving a warm welcome, the Verdubans trooped on island in the hope of meeting the cannibal ruler, and were never to be seen again.\nThe painter makes clever use of light to signify the hubristic optimism of the Verduban mariners coming ashore, white sails of ears, feet and hands flying in honour of the ice god, whilst capturing a sense of their impending tragedy.",

But I couldn't accept them, I simply didn't have time.\nMy assignment, you see, took up near every waking minute. I was a cook. A really bad cook.Every day l'd get up at dawn, wander blearily from the bunks into the kitchen, don my whites and get to preparation. By midnight l'd finished, was exhausted and went home to bed. I had one day off a week. when I'd just lie half\u2014asleep in a cold bath.\nThe kitchen was attached to a busy restaurant named \"The Crescent\" at the foot of the Stalk. It could have been a fine task for some, working at a place of such high reputation, but I quickly realised I wasn't cut out for it.\nMy biggest problem was Hermonio, a chef that had been working there for thirty-five years. Every year, he turned down the annual offer of reassignment. He had loftier ambitions, he wanted to be better than Chef Molin - an unrealistic but impassioned dream. Cooking was his life, but to me it was just a job, and l was spudging things up or him.\nLike everything else, the restaurant belonged to Sabor, but Hermonio let us know in no uncertain terms that it was his kitchen.",

There were a lot of youngsters there, a lot of inexperience. but I really stood out as a weak link. A dropped pan here, an overcooked fish there, mistakes with quantities. I was all over the place, living proof that our society's work distribution model was dysfunctional, and it made Hermonio furious.\nThen one day it came to a head. i was peeling some ogballs, and I just couldn't get the technique right. I was scalping away half the vegetable with every stroke. Seeing red, Hermonio charged over to my worktop and slammed his cleaver down fowards my hand.

His company, Eagle-eye, has only been trading the brobbins and grubbins of war for five months, and yet its stellar brilliance has caught the eye of the most serious corporations of Ten-Rui.\nLast month Horris Feather had the audacity to turn down an offer of 70,000,000 Ishgiruan Spirits for his share of Eagle-eye, a company for which he has produced all the master designs himself. The bidder, Dawnfire, is the largest ship manufacturer in Ishgiru - a testament to the genius of young feather, who is only thirteen years of age.\nI visited the factory on the edge of Oppeetobee, where great chunks of forest had recently been felled to extend the boy's airfield.\nMe: Is it strange to think you own all this, and you're only 13?\nHF: Not in the slightest.

But what better distraction for the delinquents than to take pt-shots at moving targets in the hope of improving their aim?\nRangers of Aldoban were among the first called upon by Empress Tangana when the Stone War began. She and Gloam were said to have been impressed by the Rangers' disregard for rules and regulations, not to mention their fine tracking and survival skills.

But so often standing in their way, as they hung from the rafters, or poked their noses from trapdoors, was a plague of bandits. These armed thieves frequently mustered along the road to Driss in ambush. Not content just to mug the godhands, they freed any slaves as well. It is that selfless gesture that earns them a place in my compendium.",

For example, the day nine Owls gave their lives to prevent a wayward Dragon-Dog from blowing up the entire court.

The Owl Guard were hallowed, and they were dependable.",

Essedari Gymnothrusters\nMuch as it pains me to include a cohort of Saborians in this compendium, the Essedari belong as much to our lost world as anything else, and I wrote this book because I miss that place.\nThe Saborian Essedari were extraordinarily skilled athletes, who made best use of their mobility to speed between ships.  They used \"Gymnothrusters\", a backpack device I don't pretend to understand, to flly in and among their adversaries.

The Larks were a well-prepared and experienced group who, much like the bird, rose early in the morning to prepare for battle with choral song.  Once battle began they were rather different, preferring to wade heavily in aboard large and well-armoured frigates.  They blazed and blasted their way through the enemy.  They were still hanging on at the last battle of the Stone War, according to my Karemese friends in Capulca.",

The environment that bred these daredevils was unique; internecine rivalry fuelled by drink and marital jealousy. Bargu Jiu aces often took to the skies sozzled, and used to remark that their best moves could only be performed when under the influence.

They were hardy soldiers who were able to deal with the chill winds of north Chabuti, and to protect their nation right to the very last.

Sadly, a fabulous tempo and the unmatched synchronisation of their drill squares did nothing for their combat prowess. They were quickly overpowered by the Saborian army during their acquisition of Melliflua's mining reserves. Whether they were foolhardy or fully aware of their inferiority is not recorded, but I'm sure they made a great rumpus on those drums.

Despite this, the Wings were highly successful in the Stone War, some allying with the Kioki, some the Saborians.

This was the launchpad of the Silver Arrows, a gliding squadron who were commissioned to fly in dazzling formations. They were rarely deployed in live combat, being better suited to victory parades and celebrations, but when called upon during the tone War, the Silver Arrows answered. Having no engines on their gliders, they had to carefully manage heir altitude in order to avoid dropping below the clouds, but it made them adept at landing stealthily on enemy vessels. They were so effective that us Kioki designated 'silver arrow spotters\" on our vessels to watch overhead.",

Sappers\nThe Sappers of Strombiu were no more than a bunch of renegade miners, who, frustrated by the thinly-veiled exploitation of the Chabuti by the Unity, decided to turn on their own government. The Ephors were renowned for their corruption, and had been selling off Chabuti land to Kioki consortia, land that was being heavily mined to fuel Kioki's war with Sabor. The Sappers got their revenge by sabotaging mining facilities with their explosive charges. When Chabuti fell, they took their explosives ship-to-ship instead, swinging their way aboard with their fireaxes. Though they naively sided with the Saborians (as if they were any better) in the war, I still regard them among the bravest.",

They swore allegiance to whomever could pay their exorbitant fee. Onlookers said they fought like machines, rigidly violent, and that they never saw their faces for the lack grilles that covered them. They were \"shades without form, shades without colour\", and thus became better-known as the Hollow Men. In the Stone War they fought on the side of Sabor, as they had asked to be paid in feldspar crystals, which only Sabor possessed. It is not known what the Hollow Men intended to do with them, once the war ended.",

House of the Iris\nOf all those who tried to scope the entirety of Foundation, and to prove that it was not kite-shaped or flat (as was popularly held before the Hole opened up), the House of the Iris had the greatest success. They were explorers who craved danger and the unknown. In a golden age in which all had what they wanted, this was a sensation. Skimming out to the far extremities of the map, they recorded everything in detail, as is the Verduban way. The House of the Iris discovered many islands, new peoples and curiosities. They were always easily recognised, since each member of the house wore a human iris on their person.",

It was also home to the Sons of Kip, worshippers of the small moon.  They vowed to defend the true Empress with their cranequins.  Millennia later, and the order of the Sons of Kip remained, but their patron was no more.  Without an income, Kip's Keep had ruined.  The Sons of Kip were proud, and would not disband, so they agreed to pledge allegiance to others for a fee.  That way they could preserve Kip's Keep proud traditions - only males could join the Sons of Kip, and had to remain celibate.  Needless to say, any mercenaries proficient with ranged weapons are useful in skyship combat, and moreover the Sons of Kip deserved their reputation for unflappable excellence.\n",
        "25. The Cudgels of the Black Tabard.\nWe are more credulous of the stranger things now than we once were. In particular, the existence of people physiologically different to us. I remember people of Ten-Rui claiming they had met a ratwoman come to sell her inventions in the low-town. Then there is the old Saborian legend of the Queen of the ratpeople. Well, believe it or not I once met a man named Marinello, who claimed to have seen thousands and thousands of them. He said they lived in the Wahsili, a distance from the lighter of the lamps, their sacred pylon, and that they fought terrifying battles underground. Well, I have it on good authority that those battles Marinello described were a sham - a ceremonial conflict. Nevertheless I have saved a place in this book for the cudgeling rats, since I believe their very existence in such a cruel and unforgiving place as Foundation deserves our respect and gratitude.",
        "26. Hawks of Karem\nThe Hawks of Karem were of proud heritage, a band of South Karemese from the plains near Tomahon, they were known for their tactical nous, especially in ship manoeuvres - like the hawk who circles its prey before the kill.The hawks would begin battles tethered together, so that they could discuss plans and strategies, but they would quickly separate to take positions as high as they could above the clouds. The Hawks of Karem bred Captains and Admirals who served throughout the Stone War, winning many victories for the Kioki. I won't dwell on the story of Captain Astor of Karem, for he is sufficiently celebrated elsewhere.",
        "27. Rammybobbles of Mandala\nAs I wander about these islands, collecting wood and other materials, I often find myself whistling. he tunes I whistle are invariably (if I remember rightly) Mellifluan ones. I even know some of the words.\n\"Harmony...Sweet Harmony Like the bird and bee... Woooahahah, give it to me.\"\nIt can only be the work of the Rammybobbles. A conclave of poets, bards. In their time, they fought for the right to express themselves, and their voices could often be heard above the confusion that was the Mellifluan government - the cushion-slumped, warble-voiced, streamers of red tape. When I was at Capulca, I met the last of the Rammybobbles, a man named Banton. He spoke lyrically. He did not waste a word.\nHe told me that in Mandala, a suburb of Kubo, he and his friends had protested the occupation, associating with Menizes, and the resistance. I found his efforts inspiring.",
        "28. Marimbian Sabremasters\nI have long since tried to convince the little ones of the existence of mountains.  The odd island we pass supports my claim, but nothing has the scale of the Pintins, that shimmering galaxy of peaks in my homeland.\nI remember that just short of the highest peak of Tito Bipo, lived the Marimbian Sabremasters.  They were ascetics who had renounced worldly pleasures and taken to a simple life of meditation and sabre practice.  To see them swish to and fro, was like watching the dragonfly above the pond, gliding weightlessly.  Though they were masters with the sword, the monks refused to take sides during the Stone War, believing the Kioki to be greedy, and the Saborians to be misguided zealots.  Even as the earth peeled away from itself, the Sabremasters were said to have remained - their respect for the mountains keeping them there.",
        "30.The Flying Panthers\nAlmost all auxiliaries fighting for the Kioki Unity in the Stone War were in the pay of the Empress. It was the only way to be sure of convincing people to fight. Most weren't worried about the earthquakes or the threat of Sabor, or the rise to power of the Warlocks, but rather, what food could be put on the table, how high they could build their homes, and what expensive jewellery they could gift their spouses. The more useful you were in a fight, the better wage you would earn, and none earned more than the Flying Panthers. They were all-rounders, without specialism or weakness. They fought well, flew well, and they never gave an inch. For that it would be wrong not to call them heroes. Such was their fame that the children of Ten-Rui could often be seen wearing replica outfits, each emblazoned with the head of the panther.",
        "31. The Wahsili Brigands\nTourists drifting too far from the crowd near the Lighter of the Lamps might find themselves caught in a web, literally.  The Wahsili brigands fashioned webbed nets below the dunes, and covered them over with a loose layer of sand.  When unsuspecting victims triggered the trap they'd be unable to move.  The brigands would empty their pockets before dumping them somewhere, penniless and confused.  Contrary to popular belief, the brigands lived not inland, but along the coast, in towns like Rugik.  These small seaports, with their unwelcoming locals and high temperatures were rarely celebrated.  But they were as much a part of Foundation, as anything else.  Now our home is gone, we understand that even the most trivial lives mattered.",
        "33. Intucki Firescouts\nIntucki Firescouts let fire blossom along the ropeways between their wooden towers and the broad southern bays of Koinos. When the Twy-Ni-Banda snake slithered up, and wound itself around the platforms, the scouts wafted their flaming torches in the snake's direction. The Intucki were typically brash, wilfully ignorant of the outside world, and too quick to resort to violence. But it could not be said of their Firescouts, who would only attack their enemies if absolutely necessary.In 3012, a small armada arrived in Mejinka bay, looking for Atlas. Like the Intucki themselves, these speculators used fire to fend off the snakes. The scouts devised a cunning scheme to send them away. They poured a mixture of tar and tree-frog poison in circumference around their expedition party, and lit it. The speculators were trapped, and though many made it back to their ships, others suffered dreadful hallucinations; the ghostly masks of the Firescouts leaping among the flames.",
        "34. Househusbands of Panyana\nIt wasn't until late evening that their wives returned from a hard day's work at the university, and they'd have to get dinner on the table. Once the baby or children had gone to bed, then they finally had a bit of 'me' time. But how to stay awake? How to make the most of it?\nOne of the Gallish Househusbands had the idea that they'd start an evening class, which would teach the old Gallish discipline of quarterstaff.\nThe men would meet in their robes down on the black beaches of Panyana. They'd start off talking about how long it took to teach themselves to milk, or how much teething hurt their babies. Soon enough though they were up to their knees in sand, battering each other with the long wooden poles.\nBy the end, when the University itself has subsided, the Househusbands baded together aboard a ship they had built together in their free time, known as \"The Fathership\".",
        "35. The Gallish Retinue.\nThe Gallish Liaison Trustees were always certain of the Rebus, an encryption that protected Panyana University's \u00a0researches. Nevertheless, the magnificently dressed national guard, known as the Retinue, were trained to be the best. With the knowledge of the University to draw upon, these men (and occasionally women) were intelligent, well-equipped fighters. In battle, they would form \"armadillos\" with their shields to defend against enemy weaponry. Since there was no miltary tradition in Gall to speak of, the Trustees negotiated an exchange with Sabor, which placed the Retinue under severe and rapid training programmes there. The Retinue were just as nimble and light as their Saborian counterparts, and members of the Retinue often did well at the Saborian Aetherial Games. Ultimately, however, the purpose of the Retinue was to defend Gall, and that is exactly what they did.",
        "36. The Pact of Jinty\nJinty hadn't been a popular travel destination since the deafening eruption of its volcano in 2829.  It was a smoking-hot isle, and the steady babble of blue lava often formed new chains of islands.  In other words, it was the perfect place for a secret tryst.  In this case, not lovers, but skysailors.  In 2991, at the end of the golden age, fifty-three went there to plot against the Pirate King.  Because of the fall in the availability of Atlas, the Pirate King had apparently gone through a bit of a lean spell, and hadn't been very good at paying his men.  Of course, he'd made piracy outside of his circle almost impossible, and the fifty-three who met at Jinty were either very brave or very stupid.  Each remembered their pact by receiving from their ringleader, a forged steel Xiphos engraved with their vows and a symbol - a pair of interlocked arms.",
        "39. Warlocks of the Zephyr\nClouds are important, and few could claim to be as wise to their threats, as cognisant of their blessings as the Warlocks of the Zephyr. The Zephyrs carried jars of clouds they had trapped, which they stirred with their untrimmed nails.\nIt is said that some had success controlling the seasons, and were able to summon snow, wind or rain at will. I would have refuted this in the strongest terms, back when life was \"normal\", but these days I'm not so sure.\nSuffice to say, the Zephyr's instincts were truer than any Gallish mathematical calculation, and this made them useful in battle, although they preffered not to fight at all if they could help it. The account of the battle over Ternanu in 3033 records that the Zephyr's ship Cumulonimble disappeared through a thunderous cloud wall, never to be seen again."

Greyfin is the largest of them, and their master. One of his legs is deformed like a fish's fin. It is Greyfin who gathers their whispers, and from the Warlock's shoulder, pours them into his ear. Gloam keeps no coin purse, for he does not like it to dirty his fingers. He has a manservant who follows him, and unclasps the purse when the need arises.\nNo-one sits in the third chair. For this chair belongs to the Elder of the Pin. If the Elder of the Pin ever came to court, neither of his cheeks could settle on something so small. Besides the chair is too high for most to reach, and sits on the display above the green silk of the dais, just as the three nations rise to the great Pintin mountains in the north.",
        "The Empress speaks;\n\"I have very sensitive skin, and yet I feel nothing of these tremors. Why are the workers so afraid?\"\n\"I believe that they are afraid of falling, Empress,\" says a courtier. He wears an improbably tall and thin hat, of crushed green velvet. He is the Empress' thirteenth cousin, on her father's side.\n\"Well then, does it not please them to use the stones?\"\n\"Many of the stones they might have used, have fallen into the mire,\" says Nabob Vulio.\n\"What a shame - a great waste. They must indeed be careless - let us then, allow nature to determine their fate - and let us recover as much of the remaining Atlas as we may.\"\n\"I agree, Empress,\" says the Warlock of the Gloam.",
        "After the court adjourns, the Warlock strides through the hair curtain, and a smattering of the mice follow his lead. The antechamber corridor is wooden floored, polished. At the end of the corridor is the veranda, behind a set of tall glass doors. He walks towards it, and the busy merchants nod out of politeness. The Warlock is feared, not loved. Ahead of him, the mice gather at the heels of another man dressed in skins. The man begins to jump in pain, as the mice bite his ankles.\n\"Are we not meeting, Edvers?\" says the Warlock of the Gloam.\n\"Get off! Get off! Ueghegh!\" cries the man, and in his pannic, drops the cane at his side and worse, the telescopic lens from his eye. It falls and smashed on the floor.\n\"Oh Dear Edvers!\" says the Warlock of the Gloam, sardonically. The children's teeth on a string around his neck rattle.\n\"I am not so named any more, Gloam! I must remind you once again that I am Warlock of the Moss!\"\n\"Ah yes. Moss,\" says the Gloam, with a titter, \"a great honour to meet you again.\"\n\"If people know my true name to be Edvers, they may hold heuristic power over me. You of all know that it is an ill omen, Gloam.\"\n\"Ill indeed. Come, let us sit with the others.\"",
        "But lo! A Nabob approaches Gloam, and they move into the shade.\n\"May we speak privately sir?\" says the Nabob, with evident bewilderment at the practices of the chalk cirlces.\n\"I believe we are out of earshot,\" says Gloam.\n\"It is about the Atlas sir,\" says Mannigo quietly, for that is his name.\n\"Excellent. You have them then? Pin must be bled - it is good to bleed now and then. The gloam augurs it. Five nights in succession now, a bird has died, just at the precise moment that darkness has fallen.\"\n\"Far be it from me to say,\" says Nabob Mannigo, \"but does not darkness fall gradual?\"\n\"Fool! There is always a precise moment at which the coin disappears into the purse. What of the stones?\"\n\"Yes we have them, yet I fear the Pin are unhappy with the arrangement. They have heard stories of the earth tremors at Ten-Rui. They do not wish to volunteer the stones any longer. I fear the Elder of Pin may finally come to court, and take his place in the third chair.\"\n\"The third throne is no larger than one of the Empress' shoes. Should the Elder of Pin be small enough to sit on it, the Empress shall stamp said tiny person beneath her heel,\" says Gloam, waving the Nabob away.",

The blood of the fifty has been cleaned from the walls, and the Dragon-Dog captured and tossed into the hole where the low-town was. But trouble brews in the north, and the Empress must see to it.\nThe canard sail, and the raft-pull are cut free, and her lady's shep billows up like knickers on a line. The Empress' bust adorns the wooden bowspirit, leading the fleet by this token. It is ceremony from bygone days, when the wind was obliged to carry ships across the seas.\n\"It will be best if you remain below deck. Let me see to the humdrum things,\" says Gloam.\n\"Good. I find the air too bright,\" croaks the young Empress, for she has been sick of late, and lies in the sorry gloom of her naval chamber, plunking away at her Pati-Pikk. They say the recent collapse has touched her in some deep sense.\n\"Should I seek the Warlock of Forgiveness?\"\n\"Seek him not,\" says Gloam, changing the subject, \"I have situated the contraption. I hope you are well enough at least to spectate.\"\nThe Empress looks at the sorry sight before her. On the campaign table, marked with the flags of Saborian cities, Gloam has placed an unctuous and pongy cheese. Over it is a cruel-looking mousetrap. He slips a mouse from his pocket, and lets it run onto the table. It smells the air.",

If the mouse survives its peril and takes the cheese, you may lie upon the bed differently than if it is killed.\"\nThe mouse seems to realise something is amiss. It stands on two feet, and regards the Gloam uncertainly.\n\"Will the mouse not curse you Gloam, if it allies you and this mechanical danger?\"\n\"Well it might at first, but then it shall puzzle. Is the danger not of its own making? The cheese is a great prize, but a mouse can survive without it - a mouse can live an ascetic life, taking pleasure in berries and seeds that occur naturally, it does not have to gorge itself on cheese.\"\n\"I doubt if there are any berries or seeds aboard, Gloam.\"\n\"That's besides the point, Empress. This is theory.\"\n\"Well, then, it seems there are many possibilities Warlock. I am alert, and happily await the spectacle.\"\n\"Empress, I shall leave you to enjoy,: says the Warlock of the Gloam, his jagged stride engulfing the mizzen stair and bounding him out onto the deck among the company of skylers.\n\"How far to the smelly lands?\" he asks one.\n\"Not far now sir, perhaps a half-day.\"\n\"Good. Leave the other ships in the rear, so as not to fright the poor creatures. To see a third fleet upon the horizon would be to throw a sparrow among the beetles.\"\n\"I shall pass on the message, sir.\"\nWith that, the Warlock climbed onwards to the rudder. He always wants to steer.",

So he tells here that she must ready herself for a final battle, in which all humankind shall have a stake.\n\"Victory or defeat are not important, but your very participation will redeem you.\"\nShe nods weakly in agreement from her pillow, for a guilt as heavy as Ten-Rui's low-town anchors her there.

My life was court, stuck between three tiny rooms...\"\nI knew the rooms to be actual fact grandly-sized, but thought better of correcting her.\n\"...when I did have a rare moment alone, I'd gaze up at the skyships and dream of being an explorer, navigating the jungles of Koinos, or finding sunken treasure in the warm sea.

Now..let me see to my business, your highness.\"\n\"Wait. Do you remember I spoke of a development that made up my mind to call on your services?\"\nShe thrust a letter into my hands.

Nor am I suggesting that the modern Bandini, characteristically apologetic, are in any way at fault for the actions or their predecessors.\nIin 559, the disparate cities of Sabor were taken by surprise, as the Bandini, led by Alkabar, crossed what is now known as the Yellow Blood river, through the Amum mountains via skeleton pass, and ravaged the Saborian desertlands. They burned villages, looted farms, and used captives as shields. Worst of all, they set fire to, and gutted the city of Cherno, over which the modern settlement of Conos now sits. The terrifying assault was unprecedented and unexpected. Rumour has it that Epilomelos, a very small man, wobbled atop three wooden crates as he addressed an anxious crowd gathered at Momoros. He had invited diplomats from Redusa to witness the reaction of the crowd to his speech.",
        "Epilomelos' speech was one of togetherness and community. First and foremost, he argued that their land was hard to defend from outsiders, with its many subdivisions, borders, and isolated cities. Recent internal squabbles had not helped prepare against a large-scale invasion. He suggested that a combined \"Sabor\" could put an end to the Bandini threat, and do more still besides. The speech received an ovation, and the die was cast.\nEpilomelos was elected general of the armies of Sabor. He began by pincering the Bandini by unloading troops on the northern shore near the border, so as to get in behind the raiders. Soon after a massacre occured. The Bandini surrendered, but it made no difference, as the Saborians killed all their prisoners.\nSabor's transformation from disparate cities to one nation was only just the beginning. Epilomelos, by this time, was already determinedly idealistic. His rally to the Saborians was \"Why suffer like this, when we can prevent war, famine, and chaos with togetherness?\" Epilomelos showed Sabor that it was possible to make something better, something pure.",
        "Within six months, The Saborians had mobilised a large army, and stormed into Bandinia, though there was fierce fighting in the mountain passes, there were simply too many Saborians. Once they had reached Darat, they systematically executed any remaining males (for it was felt that the decision to raid Sabor was a result of Bandinia's war-like and macho governance). A memorial was erected in Darat, a gigantic pillar, topped with a sculpture of a lamb and its shepherd (it has toppled in the 19th century) and was considered a universal symbol of peace, but also a symbol of submission. The Saborians wanted to portray themselves as shepherds to a wayward Bandini flock."

      "Farming College": [
        "Part of an article published in \u201dThe Correspondent\" a left-wing Verduban news agency. A report on the agricultural college, north of Conos. The month of Qang, 2997. This translation filed away beside it in a dossier marked \"Investigate and Retaliate\u201d.\nIn one class, Bandinian serfs were seen to crawl about the floor like pigs. When asked about this, a student joked that the college could not afford to use real livestock for practice, but that here was no exhausting the supply of Bandinians.\nOne senses that the ulterior motive of Economist Nalo's policy, is to condition the Pilipai into thinking that they are not a the bottom of the pecking order. By subjugating and demeaning Bandinians, they make the Pilipai students feel good about themselves.\nAsk any Saborian citizen about the Pilipai, and they will likely state that they are unenlightened mortals choosing to live the easy life. It is obvious to an outsider however, that the Pilipai are Saborian society. They are the potwashes, the farmers, the miners, and the cleaners. Then there are the shadier professions; prostitutes, assassins, spies - all are Pilipai.\nIn short, the agricultural colleges are no longer used for teaching. There is a perimeter guard, and a high fence. There are rewards tor conformity - the promise of farming equipment, or distribution of \"cushy\" farmland (such as olive or grape crops) - only demonstrating how the focus of such institutions is not education, but the streamlining of an underclass.\nIt is one of many responses to the growing unrest among elder Pilipai, that life has grown intolerably hard. They used to trade with the Bandini, but since the situation began in Darat, very few Bandini now have cause to come into Sabor, leaving the Pilipai to trade among themselves, and enjoying a lot less\nvariety of produce. Put these things together, and Sabor appears a volcano that might erupt at any time."

        "Verduban theological tract - from the year 2998.\nAnd so in the Mellifluan canon, the god Shabo used her gigantic claws to life a rock from beneath the warm sea, and roll it atop the centipede-god Agonon. Agonon had been her lover, but had an affair with Baliandri, multi-gendered god of dualities. This, therefore, was Shabo's revenge.\nAgonon was completely covered by the boulder (which was believed to have formed Melliflua), and unable to move. Agonon was the most cunning of all the gods, and having spent a thousand years motionless in thought, a plan came to him.\nAgonon summoned tree trunks unto each of his hundred hands, and having done so, beat a rhythm upon the underside of the boulder. After a further thousand years, the drumming had reached such resonance that the rock shook. A crack appeared and Agonon squeezed his body out. She had an even larger boulder ready which she dropped immediately on his head. It is said that this second boulder formed the lands where the Chabuti now live. The Mellifuans and Chabuti still refer to their continent as \"Shabo\" in her honour.",
        "Verduban theological tract - continued\nAgonon tried in vain to summon the trees to his hands again, but he was too weak from his drumming. Still he tried to wriggle free, and they say his efforts caused the Korchis mountains to form. Whenever a temblor is felt in Melliflua, it is supposedly his tail twitching, as he dies his eternal death. His death is creation, preservation and destruction embodied. When he finally dies, it is believed the world will enter a state of dark limbo.\nThis story tells us a little about the primative Mellifluans, and how they used their fantastical gods to explain natural phenomena such as earthquakes. The question remains, however, of why these earthquakes seem now to be growing stronger each year. Needless to say, the one true god will show us in due course. Don't waste your strength cracking the icy lake, when spring, given time, will melt it.",

Wine Snecket needs to be sharp and strong with wine, and as such, it is not a dish for wee tots. The dish is normally served with sweet fresh berries and a crisp-grain tuile.\n\"Grapes with white custard.\"This time it is not just sweetness, but the comforting blanket of white custard that neutralises the gooey grapes that are in turns dried and dunked in water until they resemble gigantic sultanas.

Not a personal favourite, but distinctive certainly, and authentic.\n\"Pekoe Pekoe (with kibbles).\"The national dish, and 'ustifiably so. Yellow ratfish hot smoked in greyroot. Kibbles add some fibre and balance. A sweet almost medicinal sauce of yakka leaf is ladled over. This dish is the toughest test for a young Pekoe wife, because cooking the dish is part of a prenuptial agreement. Should the male be unhappy, it is common for the woman to remain unmarried for the rest of her life. Author's note: The prenuptial dish is traditionally served to both the bride and groom's family. As such, fights often break out when some underlying reason for the couple not to wed prevails over the quality of the cookery.

Young salt crooks are collected from the tundra, and carefully rinsed and pickled in brine so that they remain fresh and green. Boiled Ogballs bring weight and further soft comfort to the dish. As long as your ingredients are fresh, you will have no complaints from your diners, especially if the weather is bitter, and the night is long and dark.\n\"Crab Pie.\"This pie simply must be made with blubber pastry. No part of the whale goes unused by the Tarrery, and blubber is held in the greatest regard. Melting blubber down to an oil is common practice. This oil has many non-culinary uses, but here it is combined with the pastry to produce a delightful salty crust.

With skyships, it became possible for Huacanado to receive some fish, though due to the long distance from coast to capital, the dried stuff still remains central to the Pinnish diet.\n\"Pinnish Goatbear festival pudding.\" This is a curious thing, in the main because the Goatbear of Pin is an elusive creature, while its festival pudding could be said to be the least elusive of all puddings. Those that consume it, in fact, achieve a remarkable degree of conspicuousness.It is usually a tiered series of liquor-drenched sponges, through the centre of which is held a royal fruit jelly of seasonal mountain fruits.

Hawk, owl, heron, duck, chicken, goose, sparrow, turkey, swan, and lastly the centrepiece, the fried breast of a miniature eagle. Birds are iconic to the Ishgiruans, yet this dish shows the contradiction at he heart of Ishgiruan life. The best thing about it was an intense truffle cream dashed between the game.

Bean pastes and hot sauce fill flatbreads which are made in clay ovens. Sometimes grains and green leaves are served on top. A healthy dish that feeds the poorest Ishgiruans, but one I would be happy to serve in my restaurant.\n\"East coast salad.\"The east coast is a place of music and home to people who just want to enjoy life. They grow salad leaves and vegetables in little lass houses, and sometimes serve them with white fish.

They range from piquant anise to bright floral rose peppercorn, and permeate almost every dish of the Verduban repertoire.\nAsh berry soup with chicken and beer.This is a very distinctive and warming soup. The base is made with finely diced onion and beer. Once this has simmered suitably, a very thick chicken jelly stock is added, and once separated, a handful of whole ash berries are added. Once the dish has bubbled away slightly, the whole thing is sieved finely, and is served with crusty malted bread.\nNuggin-cheese tart, with lardons and winter greens.Nuggin is a flowering plant, whose seeds need a very hot summer to grow. Fortunately, the glasshouses of the aforementioned apron of temperate land in south Verduba provides just this. When added to dishes, these little seeds lend an earthy nutty flavour to mild tastes such as cheeses. Though they love stews and soups, the Verdubans also like bitter green vegetables that grow so hardily in the grip of winter.\nSeared Peppered Ox, with babyhead beans and charcoal.This Ox steak is cooked the traditional way - over an open fire.

The rates are unreasonable, but worse, it is believed a lot of the money is diverted directly into the coffers of the corrupt royal family.\n\nAll-in-all Bandinia can be expensive, or very cheap, it's up to you to get the best value you can. At first the landscape may seem barren and unkind, one of the craggy sheep hills and dusty mountain passes. But if you head to Driss in the south, a dune-like landscape unfurls, and where the ocean laps the shore, sumac and ocotillo grow.\n\nNavigating will require either a private skyship (which you can hire cheaply), or a guide and some mules (even cheaper). There are some interesting table-rock formations in the north west which jut upward above the dried-up river valleys. The old ports of the west coast are also a little-known delight, where stories abound of Bandini sailors trading with a mysterious sea-kingdom. They must be very mysterious indeed, since there is nothing west of Bandinia on any map I've ever seen.\n",
        "Places to Stay\nIn the cities, the best places to stay are probably family homes. The ramshackle hotels cost five times more, or ten, in the case of the avoid-at-all-costs \"royal\" hotels. In the evening if you wait at the clocktower in Darat's central square, you can be sure a local will approach you. Remember to stick to the negotiation rules in the introduction to the the right price.\n\nBefore long you will likely find yourself dining on authentic Bandini cuisine, and even meeting some of your hosts' extended family. Bandini families are often huge, possibly a reaction to the genocide that followed the failed incursion into Sabor by the Bandinian General Alkabar.\n\nEating\nThe Waterguji market food is spectactular, the aromas of spices so readily used in the Bandinian cuisine wafting throughout. Driss market isn't quite as big, but benefits from the coast, in that there is heaps of fresh seafood. Anything outside of the cities will be very rustic, and sometimes difficult to stomach. The East Bandinian fascination for eating monkey ears, for example, was one that was lost on me. The thing is, Bandinians do know taste, and for the most part, you should just trust instincts, if something smells good, don't be afraid to try it.\n\nMy favourite dish is Ariai, a one-pot stew made with lamb, peas, mint and ogballs. It is a staple you will almost certainly encounter if staying in a family home.\n",
        "Entertainments\nThe Bandini are a hard-working people, but they are also the creators of Foundation's best-known sport, lallara, a ball game that takes place inside a small square court. The sport is an international hit, and there is even a Verduban team (The Icebreakers). The court areas of Darat is known as Lallaralata, and is among the most developed and affluent parts of the city. Sadly much of this is an illusion, since most money in Bandinia lines the pockets of the few.\nObviously the open markets of Darat are superb, but don't forget to make a stop at the palace of the three popels, gigantic shields made of brass which adorning its domed roof.\nIn Driss, the Statues of Alacute, is a reminder that we should be very respectful of Bandinian History. These statues date from long before the Gallish calander began. Estimates vary, but some say these are as much as 10,000 years old. They are sealed in behind a wooden wall, to prevent wind-erosion.\nFor horror-trills, trek between shacks along Skeletal Pass in the Amum mountains, spending the night at each stop. It is rumoured that the skeletons after which the pass is named appear after midnight and recreate the battles that took place when General Alkabar was finally driving back to Bandinia by the armies of Sabor.",
        "Don't miss\nThe Bandini believe in a god for almost every aspect of life. Their gods are cruel and merciless, and think themselves superior to mortals, even though they'd make the worst mortals of all. Still, the Bandini celebrate them with a kind of fateful ambivalence, and nowhere is this more enthralling then along the banks of the Driss river, where a seemingly endless mural that travels through the city and up the estuary to the sea depicts the entire mythology of the gods. If you don't have time to see it from start to finish, arguably the best section appears just before the city limits on the way to the sea. I am told this chaotic and fiery design was inked as long ago as the 1200s, a time when Bandinia had scarcely recovered from the Saborian genocide. It is preserved in a coating of resin once every twenty years.",
        "Watch Out For \nPenitents - Avoid the river bank in Darat, since the \"yellow-blood\" river is the haunt of a particularly despicable group of Bandinians. These are the yellow-blood penitents whose interpretation of Bandinian school teaching is taken to the extremes. They self-flagellate, causing harm to themselves in the hope that it will one day ease the burden of guilt felt by Bandinians over their past. \nIt is worth noting that many Bandinians hold a similar, though more moderate view, since the Bandini school curriculum is still heavily vetted by Sabor. This is a peculiar arrangement, but one believed key to a lasting peace between the nations.\n\nLitter - Litter and detrius is everywhere in Bandinia, a problem not helped by the lack of infrastructure, and a general carelessness about personal hygiene. Wash your hands often, drink only fresh running water, or boiled water, and keep your feet well-covered.\nHeat - As you head out into the desert, always carry water with you, as while there are plenty of oases in the desert basins, you may find the water is toxic. Temperatures in direct sunlight can be unbearable, so take a good broad hat (like a Tarrery hat) if you are unfamiliar with it.\nIllness - It is common to pick up a bug when in Bandinia, and if you do, it is better to deal with it yourself since reports of medical care sound terrifying. But do not let any of that intimidate you into not making a trip. Bandinians are lovely, incredibly humble people, who are welcoming and kind."

      "Hette Boege Guide to Northern Sabor": [
        "<A Saborian edition of an introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>Northern SaborSabor is perhaps the most naturally beautiful and yet architecturally advanced of societies in the west. Nowhere is this more evident than in the northern cities of Agbana, Momoros and the capital Redusa. The difficulty is that tourism is only beginning to find its feet in Sabor, and you will find yourself chaperoned by a delegate as soon as you declare your foreign nationality.\nThe Saborians themselves are a deeply optimistic and fortunate people. Your guide will be permanent for the duration of your stay (maximum two weeks if you wish to go landside, with no return within a year) and will have been assigned to you from a pool of tourist guides, so it's luck of the draw I'm afraid.\nI've been to Sabor twice, and on both occasions had excellent and knowledgeable guides who were quite relaxed about my questions and heading off the beaten track. I have heard stories of less welcoming visits, but I think they are few and far between. The success of the Saborians often incites jealousy, and many take any opportunity to discredit their system.",
        "Fees\nPolitics aside, heading into Sabor proper will come at significant personal cost. To even get in you will need to donate a significant sim in luxury materials (there is a list available at Muskdog skyport). This will determine the length of your stay, up to a maximum of two weeks. I paid six kilogram of Tungsten, setting me back 800VN at the time of writing. Guests are welcome in Sabor, but you must play by the rules, or suffer the consequences (See the section on Southern Sabor for information about \"ditching\", an illegal activity which is not at all recommended.)\nOne break that you may not have foreseen, is that paying your fees entitles you to free travel, food and accommodation, chosen by you. Although the fee itself still makes a trip to Sabor more expensive than most holidays, it is made more reasonable by the knowledge that you won't need to open up our purse on the other side. Don t expect all you can eat though. Portion sizes are controlled to the weight of a feather, and over-eating is considered a grave offence, which could see you sent packing. Travel is also quite limited, thought your guide will endeavour to make arrangements at your request.",
        "Places to Stay\nAccommodation in Sabor being free, you are entitled to stay at any of the purpose-built travel hotels around the central hubs of Redusa and Momoros, or along the ocean view swoosh at Agbana. A Saborian will no doubt tell you that no single hotel is objectively better than another, since they are all furnished identically. Of course, in reality there are many reasons not to pick one at random. in Redusa, Vitellus' Hotel is very popular as it is nearest to both the steeple gardens and Molin's Restaurant (see Entertainments) and its owner seems to take a great more care in his business than others, for example in some hotels you will see signs up for most of the day saying \"Out at the cloistrum, back in 20 minutes\". The simple truth is, a lot of Saborians don't enjoy the jobs they have been given, and will do the absolute bare minimum. Although reporting bad practice might seem helpful, your guide (who will stay in the same hotel as you) should take care of that for you. Criticism of any kind may land you in hot water. These are gods, remember!",
        "Eating\nSaborian street vendors are generally worth stopping at. Pilipai attend the stalls, but they are managed by citizens. Produce is always fresh, and your guide will extol the abundant Tava fruit, which Saborians believe very important to maintaining good physique. To my taste it has a strangely savoury note, but it does seem to be doing their health some good - you will find it hard not to gawp at the beauty of the Saborian citizens, whose skin shines, whose muscles ripple, whose hair is rich and dark.The Saborians spend a huge amount of time outside in the sun, and are always game for sport before mealtimes, or a good walk after. Obviously the standout cookery can be found at Molin's Cafe. I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Gugustus Molin on my last visit, a charming man in every regard. He is only young, but taking the culinary circles of Sabor by storm. You eat very well at Molin's, though it is so popular now that your guide may be unable to make a reservation. If you are lucky enough to get in however, you will find a range of dishes from all over Foundation the set menu taking up an entire day's food stamp (so choose wisely). Regardless, it is an absolute privilege to eat there.",
        "EntertainmentsJust walking around the centre of Redusa could take up the whole of your two week stay. Obviously the Stalk building is a must-see, being a miracle of design inside and out. You'll be shown to he viewing platform, which is about 435m from ground level. Above that is the Committee and assembly rooms, all contained in the iconic mushroom disc.\nMomoros and Redusa have the river delta, and some magnificent gardens. Agbana has a bright and shimmering seafront, with (aquatic) ferries that can take you to the offshore islands. Tonking tournaments are frequent in all three cities - a sport with sticks and glass. There is a well-tended Zoo at Momoros home to the many curious plants and animals of the Mount of Plenty, and in Redusa, theHistory of Sabor museum is fascinating if a little partisan (Warning it has no language cards).\nYour guide will take you to the local cloistrum on a daily basis. If you don't want to be embarrassed, stay clear of the Boros pool (see page 84), and get a back scrub by the excellent masseuses of the Depurgum instead. You are also welcome to attempt to scale the Apotheon, for the simple reason that it causes the Saborians great pleasure to see foreigners fail at it even more horrifically than they themselves do. It really does take a lifetime to master.",
        "Don't Miss\n The Redusa University is extremely old, dating from 1186. Situated in the Pilipai town, which you will need to take an elevator to access, the University is a vast splendid building, and still a functional one. The crenelations on its upper stretch of wall are typical of the \"crescent\" period, during which friezes and murals of everyday life were particularly popular. Many of these depict the god-king Epilomelos and symbolic representations of various city-states that united in the lst millennium.\nDue to the lack of uptake in learning above academy level, the University is an empty part of town, perfect for a bit of quiet time.",
        "Watch Out For\nHeat - Though you may be tempted to stay outside by the water's edge all day, the temperatures this near to the equator can be dangerous. Always drink plenty of water, and carry a sunshade if you have fair skin.\nAgeism - If you are clearly over the age of fifty, you may notice a difference in the way you are treated. Since you are not a god, it won't prevent you from visiting, but your guide won't let you enter the Cloistra, and you might find you are treated like a second-class citizen. If you are a Saborian-speaker, you might overhear mutterings such as \"no-one's going to clean up after you here.\" This perception is so prevalent among Saborians that even the Pilipai of the city are individually selected to be young and attractive.\nThere is almost no crime in Northern Sabor, which is remarkable. There are however, many pitfalls of etiquette that may land you a night in the cells. Do not ask questions about politics, and above all, do not mention rumours of relations between citizens and Pilipai. This is a deep source of shame for Saborians, and may hit a nerve."

      "Hette Boege Guide to Southern Sabor and the Studded Desert": [
        "<A Saborian edition of an introductory section of an old tourist guidebook>Southern Sabor and the Studded DesertThe south of Sabor is home to only one large city - the sprawling Conos. The name Conos is believed to have been derived from the ancient \"Koinos\", the southern continent from which all humans came. The city itself is a fiercely hot, but otherwise upholds the modern living of its northern counterparts.\nThe people of Conos tend to be a good bit more laid-back than the itinerant northerners, but the flipside to this, is that they seem to be more bigoted, and are quick to distrust outsiders. Look no further than their relations with the Bandini, who even in these happy times are used as cusswords.\nThe Pilipai seem particularly underprivileged in the south, and although my guide in the region made a point of heading to the Pilipai club, on the outskirts of Conos, a place for hard-working farmers and miners to relax, I wasn't convinced. Especially when I insisted we visit the Studded Desert (see places to stay) and I saw a group of nomadic Pilipai known as \"wastrels\" collecting and chiselling gemstones in very basic conditions. \"They're happy enough,\" was all my guide would say on the subject.\nIn the city though, there are some wonderful moments. The Apocali Gardens are mesmerising (see Entertainments) and the Saborians certainly know how to have good clean fun. Beyond Conos, there is wilderness in every direction, with the Mount of Plenty being a memorable three-day excursion.",
        "Places to Stay\nAs with the north, accommodation is free, and there is nothing shabby about the hotels in Conos. They have a different vibe to them than the ones in the north. Roomier, with great big fans to keep them cool. You will seldom find hoteliers at their desks however, as it is widely accepted that Conos citizens are the laziest workers of all Saborians. You might find your hotelier lounging on the terrace, or down at the Cloistrum. The music nights in the summer at the Turgus Hotel are captivating, though you don't have to stay there to enjoy them.\nIf you want to stay in the wilderness, you are entirely in the hands of your guide, who will often know a Pilipus well enough to organise a night's stay. I once stayed in a wonderful seaside resort at Gratta (where Saborians citizens go to relax in mid-summer) where the Pilipai grilled fish on open fires, and the swimming and boating was fabulous. The trouble is, it can be quite hard to steer your guide, as the towns outside Gonos are small and frequent, and have little understanding of fun.",
        "EatingA delicious speciality of Conos is a savoury pastry called \"Mallum\". Mallums are conical and have a range of fillings. Sour cheese and the dark Mallum leaf from which the snack takes its name is the traditional and most common one. if you can make a trip to the Mount of Plenty, you will find fish and berries and much else besides. A good guide can make the hike up to the mount one of the trips of a lifetime if he knows how to forage. Some guides are better than others, so think twice before eating anything you are given.\nEntertainmentsThe Apocali Gardens in Conos contain every known species of plant in Sabor. Particularly exciting is the \"Danger Zone\", a living museum of some of the weirdest and deadliest plants in Foundation. On entry you are given a set of long rubber gloves, and an eyemask. Like many museums, it was recently opened up to Pilipai, Citizens and visitors alike. Therefore expect a good crowd.\nDancing is extremely popular here, including the salacious belly-shuffles of ancient times. do not be fooled, the dancers may be looked at, but it is deeply ungodly to even approach one of them. There are dance halls everywhere, and you will be encouraged to participate in some of the other dance styles such as Mestallus, a sedate and sensitive dance that requires a rhythm in three-time.\nMost of the other entertainment on offer in southern Sabor relates to trekking and exploring the desert wilderness. There are specialist citizens designated for this exact purpose, so expect to wave goodbye to your city guide. in reality, exploring is not as free as it sounds. The guides stick to set paths, and will almost certainly refuse to deviate from them.",
        "Don't MissThe Studded Desert - many have been taken in by this breathtaking sight, a glittering carpet of gemstones buried in dirt. What caused its formation is unclear, but its place in Saborian life and legend is massive. It provides the seemingly endless source of mineral resources (although strangely little Atlas) upon which the four cities thrive.\nThe largest town in the desert is Jeiuna, perhaps home to a thousand gem scratchers. It has water, but that's about it. Expect to be well-prepared, and your guide to baulk at the idea of heading into the desert, since Citizens never wish to be too far from the city.",
        "Watch Out ForBe careful if you do enter the wilder parts of South Sabor. There are wildcats everywhere, the Fear Cat being twice your size, and partial to the taste of human flesh.There are special perils in the Mount of Plenty region, including the Siren plant that reacts to contact with the skin by giving off a chemical alerting all of its species to your presence. The Sirens will all then simultaneously expand to five times their size, attempting to corral you.An experienced guide will often keep a long knife for just such situations.\n\nDitching - As was noted in the section on Northern Sabor, entering the country is expensive, restrictive and brief.Some travellers choose to circumvent this by \"ditching\". I.e. landing skyships unauthorised in empty parts of Sabor in the name of adventure. Apart from the fact that you are committing a crime (punishable by death in the worst cases) you will find it extremely hard, even in the laid-back south, to avoid questions about your identity.The little book of entitlements not being in your possession will put even a Pilipus on alert, and with the rewards, make them likely to report you to the authorities.\nBandinians - You will notice there are quite a few Bandinians in this region, although not in Conos itself.They are immediately recognisable by their shabby dress, and the men by their long moustaches. They are the only non-Saborian nationality with free passage, and are left unsupervised and unrestricted in their travel around Sabor. There are several reasons for this, according to Thaumenon, one of my guides in Bandinia. One he says, was that Bandini used to get past the border control or ditch so often, that it was tiresome for the Saborians to regulate. Two, the Bandini are so afraid of the Saborians, that they generally don't stay for long. Three, they provide a valuable exchange of goods with the Pilipai when travelling around. Bandinians travelling in Sabor are often dangerous to non-Saborians, as they will think you an easy target for crime."

Many of these are actually used in ritual practice by the Warlocks (rabbit tail, raccoon liver) but you may find they suggest natural ingredients as remedies for all kinds of conditions.\nThe warlocks are a sight to behold at debate, particularly when the chalk circles are full. There is usually a healthy rivalry between them as the try to assert authority over one another, in the hope of rising up the food chain.\nWhile brutal, no one can deny that duelling is exhilarating. Sometimes ceremonial, other times violent, it is deeply rooted in Karem life. If you do visit Albodan, you could visit the Grunee Brothers' workshop. The geriatric twins are quite happy to show you around, as long as you leave any opinion on the propriety of weapons at the door. These men are passionate craftsmen, and claim that what people do with the weapons they buy isn't a matter for them to be concerned with.",
        "Don't Miss\nNaturally there are some magnificent treks through the Karem mountains, and particularly around the River Kar heading inland. Taking a guide is a good idea, though may find they don't have a lot to say. There's climbing to be done here too, although the region has a mixed safety record, so make sure you have a reputable instructor and good equipment.\n\nWatch Out For\nUnfortunately there is only one resolution to a quarrel in these parts, and that is duelling. This may be the conclusion of even the most trivial disagreement, so my advice is, do not make yourself difficult company.\n\nPerhaps worse than this, is the recent state of robberies, particularaly on the alpine pass that crosses the border into Pin. The robbers are treefolk, who dwell in the large trunks of the Widder Tree, and will often ambush you from high above. If you do go this way, be sure to go armed yourself. It might even be better to avoid the road entirely if you feel confident enough to head across country."

        "Places To Stay\nStaying in one of the many shell-shaped hotels around the city is a jolly way to experience Pin life. Researchers at Panyana have recently suggested the desire to hear the sea is embedded within us all. Being so high up, the Pin began building the shell buildings to recapture that feeling because they missed it so much. The juxtaposition of the sound of the waves, and a view over a mountain town, is one to be found nowhere else.\nFurther inland, the mountains explode. The highest peak, Tito Bipo (translates as \"sweet grace\") is twice as high as the city of Huacanado, and has never been properly climbed. Nevertheless the Pinnish flag, horizontal stripes of orange and yellow, was recently lowered onto the peak. If you happen to be passing by (and have carefully checked the weather, which can be treacherous at that altitude) there are one or two flatter slopes towards the summit, on which a skyship can neatly fit.\nAt the very foot of Tito Bipo is the small city of Marimbi, where red and yellow pennants light up the path to the mountain shrine. Although almost perpetually in shadow, and half a league shy of the peak, they still promise incredible views. You will inevitably be offered a space in one of the elder tents for the evening, as they'll really love having you there. It's usually a bed that has never been used, as if saved especially for your visit."

        "Oppeetobee had been home to some of the greatest debates, and the chalk circles drew a mighty crowd.\nI was determined to find in that crowd, the most disreputable and scruffy man I could, and if not to kiss him, then pretend to do so, and let my father catch wind of the gossip. But I was so captivated by the roar of the crowd and the bickering of the warlocks, I entirely forgot my quest.\nWhen the debate was over, I went for a walk. The city was old, with some of the rickety charm the Karemese loved. They were a sly people, who looked at one another conspiratorially when I walked by, Before long, our little group had wandered out of town and into the hills. I skipped ahead excitedly.\n\"Please wait dear lady Rosetta,\" Savoie cried, but I ran faster and faster until their voices were far behind. Orange and yellow trees seem to grow up around me. I discovered I was frightfully lost.\nIt was then that I heard a gazumphing. Wondering what it was, I followed the sound. It brought me to a large clearing, at the centre of which stood a tall young man with the dark complexion and blond hair so particular to the Karem.

        "I learned little of farming, and a Pilipus can use little else. It troubled my mother, who said, \"if you don't expect to work, you shouldn't expect to feed.\"One day, Cross Fields came together for harvest. Mannequins stuck the wagons, and the wall was built for steepling. Third, a pedestal was stood for funnymen.My mother and sister excited me into performing. I told them \"I'm no funnyman\", but they wouldn't hear of it.I confess, there are moments of my illusyon that depend upon the titivation of an audience to laughter, such that they do not see the exercises of my hands.This was excuse enough for the crowd, and the surprising arrival of my doves from nothing diminished all the competition! Many offered up the things they had brought to market as reward for the spectacle, and I was the talk of Cross Fields.\nAfter that, it grew beyond pastime. I'd visit the farms of the crescent, receiving whatever they'd to offer - supper, clothes they'd darned - in return for an evening's entertainment.\nFor many years did I make such amiable circuits. I needed only to provide for mesel', and in the evening I made merry on the wine slopes. The vintners treated me to it, for they had privilege, theirs being an endurin' commodity.",
        "But summat awoke in me at thirty. I longed for company, and before long I'd taken a wife. Not long after that, came lit'luns. A zest filled me to brimmin' (I had their needs to account for, see) and I desired to grow an enterprise of my illusyon.\nI procur'd paper from the pappymill, ink from the sea-fishers, and I set about the manufacshure of handbills. I had them scattered in each place, writ with the particulars of my shewings.When I next performed, oh how they did flock! So many, I couldn't hope to greet 'em all. I decided that thereafter an entrance levy should be applied in gen'ral terms, comprisin' whatever produce each guest could muster. I own, there were murmurin's about he propriety of it even then, but I had to make a livin' somehow.\nMy wife, while not a beauty, became greatly important. More so p'raps, than I. She saw to the lit'luns, but still found time to barter with our neighbours. What good were five boxes of corn, when we could only use one? The wife saw that livestock and supplies came our way, and even wooden toys for the lit'luns.\nMuch of the overrun went to mother and father, who had waited so long to see a benefit in me! I used wood from down the lane to construct a fine dwellin' for our young family, with lands all around.",
        "When I were cut loose I had not a trifle to my name, and I lamented that I must return to a humbler life.As I departed the gaol by the gate, a pale woman approached me. Strange voice she did have, claimin' to be steward of a \"frillship\". A vessel of \"significant portions.\"\nShe'd borne witness to my trial, and knew everythin' on the matter - and every other matter too. Not a lot of it stuck to me, except that she wished for my presence aboard her vessel, whereabout I could continue my favourite illusyons in return for gold. Gold!\nIt all sounded rather plum. I was even given a warm coat, assuredly lined with the long-neck wool of far Pin. We took to the shipyard, where he vessel was moored. Never in all my days.. This ship, the Diva, was vast!\nWe broke from Momoros, and I was skyborne for the first time in my life. The itin'ry was detailed, and I would begin at the foot o' the bill, to \"learn my craft\". Not much room for learnin' so late in life I thought - I was then thirty-six or thereabouts - but illusyon was my love, and those exercises of the hands were somewhat known to me already.",
        "After fifteen years aboard the Diva, I was known to most of Foundation as \u201dPhantom Hands\" on account of my dextrous illusyons. Known equally well, because I used it for patterin', were my complaints regardin' the God'nds, and their treatment of my family.I was vouched for by some Verduban friends, who I did tell about life as a Pilipus. The horror of it confounded 'em, and they soon petition'd Sabor, havin' agency in the writing of newspappy articles.\nThe matter inflat'd far beyond my means. Sabor, hearin' their good name dragged in dirt, gave apology, with which my friends were still not content. I'd not invited their protestations, yet they argued my cause longer and louder than I'd ever think to.\nSoon I was invited by the Utopian herself, to the Stalk in Redusa, to settle. Eager to see the matter closed, I made my way to the capital.",
        "As it turned out, this 'ere Utopian asked me if I'd be an hon'rary citizen. She said I was god, and that my illusyons had brought glory to Sabor. She said my wife and lit'luns could be made citizens too, and I'd be free to live in a city habitat with all my needs met.\"Redusa?\" I said.\"Wherever you wish,\" she said.Of course agreed to it without delay. I longed to be back on home soil, it being in my blood, and restorin' my family.\nMy newspappy friends ditched me when they found out, what with the 'hippocrissy\". My shipmates too, wondered how I could \"live a lie\", and so the Diva sailed on without me.\nAt first, it was a fine life. My distrac-shuns proved popular as ever, and l was taken with the city and my spacious residence.But when l inquired as to the wellbein' of my wife and lit'luns, l was inform'd they'd long been dead. Died of the wastin' disease, so common among Pilipai.\nThere be an despair, for they could not now come to the risin' place with me. The whole circumstance contriv'd by the Utopian, who'd've known full well of their passin' when we met. It made me wonder to what other dishonesties l was bound."

      "Koinos Debunking the Myth": [
        "(A tentative translation from the original Gallish by\nArchdean Cambrina)\nIt's an accepted fact that the Pekoe, in spite of their arcane lifestyle, deserve respect. One can't help but think that this is because they are so useful to us, thanks to the success of the great hospital at Capulca (though even if the hospital weren't there, the Pekoe would carry on just the same). Yet the prevailing assumption is that the Pekoe are the only people of Koinos we should care about. In reality there are hundreds of tribes deeper in the jungle, all with a comparable level of knowledge and connection to nature. Lately many of these tribes have been lost, giving up their own values and culture and moving within the comforting bounds of Capulca.",
        "Koinos remains, even after two-hundred years of sky travel, an underexplored land. The lack of open spaces for landings, and the fearsome Twy-ni-Banda snake are a challenge for even the most intrepid skyfarer. Long may it remain so - lest we disturb the symbiosis these tribes share with their surroundings.The Tamoe for instance, who are often mistaken for the Pekoe, are progenitors of many of the ideas used by their better-known neighbours. Their language and lifestyle however, is entirely different. They revere and learn from the small mammals of Koinos, that have adapted to outwit the snakes.\nIt doesn't end there. Gaining an understanding of the snake-men of far west Koinos has enabled us to discover previously unknown uses for Twy-ni-Banda venom. The snake-men attempt in all ways to align with the snakes, and much of their adolescence is spent emulating the behaviour of snakes, in order that both human and reptile can coexist within their communities. The venom is used at Capulca hospital for all kinds of treatments.",
        "Such ingenuity is ubiquitous. The lntucki tribe of south Koinos or instance, have over the course of many generations, learned the art of constructing sand fortresses along the southern coast. Water is anathema to the snakes, and so the lntucki use fire to bait them out to the sand, before snaring them and cooking them over an open fire. If it weren't for the snakes, an inhabitant of a bustling Metropolis like Fasio, Kubo or Ten-Rui might think this simple life bliss.\nFinally, the Shamoe tribe of north Koinos are as fascinating as any. We know they live deep inland, but all other information on them is based on the stories told by the Pekoe and others. This is because no northerner has ever actually seen them, and it is this expert camouflage that has kept them safe from the Twy-ni-Banda.",
        "All this makes recent developments all the more troubling. The amount of money arriving in Capulca could change the Pekoe. Though the amenities are basic and in many cases token (quaint shops, and nods to the Gallish pantheic calendar for example) there is no doubt they are at the sweet spot between traditional and modern living. Their proximity to the coast, in an area relatively thin with jungle fauna and numbers of Twy-ni-banda, means they are a safe bet for medicinal tourists. But how long will it be before they themselves start to lose touch with their own traditions?\nI asked their leader Ah-Nut what he thought.\n\"The hospital is very important to us. We are grateful for it, but we hope this is where it ends. We have a lot of clean rooms now to help our patients feel comfortable and safe, but all our medicine begins and ends out there, in the forest.\"\nThose too, are my observations. For now, the Pekoe have the balance right. Let us hope that is how they continue "

Then I hear a clattering inside the wall, and I know I'm on the right track; there must be an opening up above for the gunships.\nExhausted, I reach the top platform.

I get a better view of the Terminal interior from here. A couple of docked ships, a series of ramps and walkways leading to the various subsections, just like the blueprints I'd seen. I drop down to an empty level, and cling to the topside of a beam.\n\"Bandinian?\" I hear a two-pip godhand shout below, \"get him to a cell\".\nI watch as the young man tries to resist - a shock to the neck pacifies him. I ab-hop carefully down the interior wall, jabbing my knife in the cracks until I am within reach of the two-pip and his prisoner. As they turn, I drop in behind. They proceed through the red-lit landing towards the secure area.\n\"Clearance?\" says another godhand up ahead, and I duck behind an open door.\n\"74X\" says the guard, and they are buzzed through. I don't have time to be looking for another way in, so wait for the three-pip to turn his head, before plunging into his neck. Once he is completely dead, I heave his body into an empty crate under the stairs and close the lid.A flicker of guilt.",
        "I remember Oro twitching as he died, and then a look of faint contentment on his face - some final vision of him and his boy skipping happily through a Saborian arboretum. A misguided man, but at least he found something to cling on to. More than I could say for myself. Too many bodies. I dropped Snake's knife and began to sob.\nI should have focused. If I'd one out the way I came in, I'd be on a skyship by sundown. But the alarm sounded. I heard the pounding of godhand boots. They would be upon me in moments. I couldn't think, I kept breathing too fast, I was panicking.\nThen I was soothed. A clean pain lanced between my ribs, and a hand reached over my mouth.\n\"Hush,\" said a bewitching voice, and she moved me to one side. I was paralyzed.\nI watched the godhands stream in as if they were a dream. Somehow they found the bodies, but they didn't see us. They looked and looked, and I felt like shouting, \"I'm here, I'm here. Why can't you see me!?\" because then I knew it would all be over sooner.\nI could no longer feel it, but I think the hand was still over my mouth. As they dragged the bodies away, I couldn't keep my eyes open any more."

Yesterday I send her down with my book of entitlement, and she came back with no meat. We all like a good bit of meat. She told me afterward that the storekeeper didn't let her have the special goods, and would only give her Ogballs.

The food is buttery. There are purple flowers with mouths that swallow insects! \n\nCall me mortal, but here is proof that Sabor enjoys not everything. \n\nTake my assignment - I am to acquire samples of Pinnish toys, so that the factory can replicate them. The replicas are adequate, but the Pinnish ones are lovelier. Soon these replicas will be made on a larger scale and distributed for half a yellow stamp. I daresay it would be easier if we just exchanged some of our own goods for the genuine toys, but the Economist prohibits it. \n\nStill, I couldn't resist. I enclose an authentic Pinnish doll, Which I hope you receive intact. See how its eyes turn as you tilt it, and that it makes realistic noises!

Sini says she will name our school after him, when we make our school.\nThe main fact about me is I told everyone about the gods, because they don't know about Pekoe gods.

        "Day 1829.\nAfter a week of travel and petty engagements, we find ourselves on a diplomatice mission over Verduban territory. The intention of an upcoming meeting is to discuss sharing a supply of untapped Atlas in the cold north sea.\nCommunication has proved difficult, but we are making progress. We arranged to meet an aide of the House of Ice outside the citadel at Muskdog, and before I set it off, myh culture officer Dormio tried to offer some advice;\n\"...and they will expect you to wear simple dress. They are moderate-\"\n\"-I have heard storied of their so-called 'moderation',\" I chuckled.\n\"The storied of nudity are, generally, unfounded sir,\" he smirked, \"we need you to be on best behaviour. If we can guarantee Atlas here, the Economist, and the Committee will be appeased., and we can continue on our way.\"\n\"We have a duty to the Verdubans' best interests. We cannot coerce them into accepting terms that are heavily weighted in our favour.\"\n\"We have the authority to use-\"\n\"That's enough, Dormio!\" I smiled, \"If the negotiations fail, you can blame it on me. Now...what's the food like in Muskdog?\"\nHe's a good man, Dormio, and like all of us her's worried about our livelihood, but I can;'t allow personal gain to interfere with what I consider moral obligation - to treat all the people we meet with equal respect.",
        "Day 1844.After the failure of the negotiations at Verduba, there was understandable concern among the crew that we would be summoned to Momoros and lose our commission. Fortunately, the admiralty want to keep us together. Methusan's popularity grows, and he won't risk upsetting the nanban cart by decommissioning his flagship.\nHowever, we were told this was our last chance. They sent us south, to Bandinia. It is always a troubled place, in no small part due to us Saborians. It is a mission requiring the utmost delicacy, and I regret that they have given us authority to declare war if negotiations with King Orthosa are unsuccessful. War with Bandinia is an eventuality I refuse, even as a last resort.",
        "Day 1845.We approached the Bandinian frontier from the warm sea, and over the studded desert. As the light was beginning to fade, the jewels in the desert twinkled. Our course was direct, and we were surprised to find a vessel in our path, not far north-east of Darat.\n\"It is Bandinian,\" said Cait, \"Maneuverable. We should be cautious, sir.\u201d\nCait's prudence has saved my life, and the life of my crew on more than one occasion. While we don't always agree, she is the fire to my ice, the rage to my calm. I am grateful to have her by my side.\n\"Very well. Patri, man the lights if you will.\"\n\"Yes, sir.\u201c\nPatri rotated the spotlight upon the other ship, then at my command, blinked some code; We are a peaceful Saborian vessel, we mean you no harm. There was a pause of some length before there were signs of movement on the rogue ship's deck. A light flickered on, and in a few moments we received their reply; Prepare to be boarded.",
        "Day 1845 (continued...)\n\"They're powering up engines,\" said Cait.\nSeveral hatches opened up along their bow, and cannons nosed out in our direction.\n\"Options?\"\n\"We are goliath class, sire. We have a good deal more firepower.\"\n\"Hold fire,\" I said, \"Send the message again.\"\nPatri flashed the light; We are a peaceful Saborian vessel, we mean you no harm.\nThere was no effect, the ship maintained course.\n\"We are wide open to attack, sir\" said Clevedore, \"by boarding, or from their guns. Suggest evasive maneuver, then priming the cannons!\"\n\"Maintain current heading. Do nothing else,\" I remember shouting., and I was right. I was right.\nThe hostile dance amounted to little more than a fly-by, our dorsals practically touching he Bandinian ship as it passed. Hanging there from the rigging, was a slight and bare-chested boy of no more than fifteen. He gazed unblinkingly up at us, chewing, admiring our ship. It was in that moment I knew he was the only one aboard.",
        "Day 1851We were diverted to the city of Driss. I am told that the capital, Darat, is unsafe. Rioters there protest the mining of Atlas, which they believe is causing the quakes and I wondered if that might affect our meeting. It was therefore agreed that Vilanthrus of Driss, a senior counsel, would open his doors to us instead.\n\"Welcome,\" our host said, \"please Captain, sit down and share a drink. I've arranged a pleasant stay for your crew outside the city, in the desert garden of Calipolon\".\nI was surprised at the considerable welcome party crowding the low-vaulted throne room, nobles and significant persons of the state. Among them, a young man stood out. He had fine clothes, and the unmistakably cynical eyes of a born patrician.\n\"That's a kind offer, but unnecessary. I will need my crew's expertise in these negotiations, you see.\"\n\"I'm afraid it is not allowed. I was told by your admiral himself, that a private agreement would be reached between the two of us,\" said Vilanthrus haughtily.",
        "Day 1851 (continued...)\nI must have let out a visible sigh. What had commander Methusan agreed this time? Vilanthrus eyed me strangely.\n\"Very well. Leave us,\" I said to the crew. Cait looked irritable as she left, and mouthed something. The nobles too were hustled out, all but one remained; the smartly-dressed young man I had noticed.\nVilanthrus twizzled his moustache. Then he stood up and went to the cabinet to pour himself some wine. The young man strode over confidently, and sat upon Vilanthrus' seat.\n\"I am King Orthosa,\" he said quickly, \"very brave of you, to come here.\"\n\"Brave?\" I said, and I made a quick move for the door. The guards barred my way.\n\"No need to escape Captain. You have nothing to fear, from us at least.\"\nWhat is the meaning of this?\"\nOrthosa laughed, \"all in good time Captain, but for now, relax, enjoy the delights of the palace.\"",
        "Day 1852 (continued)\n\"Oh dear Captain. That is not the answer we Saborians were hoping for,\" he began, jutting his chin upward. \"Orthosa here is doing a fine job already. In the last year alone, we have recoupe three-fifths of all Atlas mined in Bandinia. By 3020, we will have the lion's share.\"\n\"And the will of the people? The riots?\" I said.\nMethusan put his arm on the back of the throne, and young Orthosa looked smug. I could see Methusan was acting out the role of the encouraging father, at least, while Orthosa was still useful to him.\n\"If they don't know what's good for them, then Orthosa here shall legislate. We can make them work if we need to, just like it used to be. In return for these small sacrifices, the King and Vilanthrus here have the freedom of a sublime palace, and everything else they desire. Just think Captain Ajacuss, that could have been you. YOu could have had my special favour, if only you and your damned crew did as you were told.\"\nOrthosa raised an eyebrow. I hung my head in shame. What had become of my people? Saborian-Bandinian relations plunging into darkness anew, and I, powerless to stop it.\nThe door burst open. It was Cait. She raised her crossbow and fired. The bolt stuck Vilanthrus in the neck, and he fell, retching in blood.\n\"Run Captain!\" she cried, as the guards rushed to attack her.\n\"No!\" I cried, rushing to her defence. I hauled the guards off of her. Then the others arrived and the guards were overwhelmed. When they had been disarmed, their hands were bound."

        "The perimeter of the mine is punctuated by hastily-constructed blockhouses, which are cracked and broken down from the quakes. Holes are filled with bits of debris. The crickets chirp, the moons are half full. Godhands strut rigidly along the wall, stopping at intervals to talk.\n\"Look, up there,\" points Lois. Above the command centre is a grey platform docking freight ships. A trio of Essedari scan the horizon with their binoculars from a control tower nearby.\n\"That's them. Just do what you do, and it'll be fine,\" says Alika. He takes off his long mantle, and reverses it, so that the lining is on the outside. The lining is white and bears the angel insignia of Sabor.Lois is dressed head-to-toe in black, her belt heavy with gizmos.\n\"Do you think what we are doing will help?\" she says.\n\"Not the time, Lois. Focus on the job.\"\nHe takes his timekeep from his pocket, and then replaces it.\n\"Ready?\"\n\"I'm ready,\" she says. She unpins her glass moustache, and hands it off to Alika, \"if I don't come back, you could use one.\"\n\"Very funny. Good luck.\"",
        "She lopes panther-like to point. She aims for the spot equidistant between two floodlamps, and the godhands don't see her as she takes two long strides, jumps into the fence, and twists over it. Alika swings his goggles up to the control tower. The Essedari are still going about their routines, and he breathes a sign of relief.\nInside the walls there is a general hum of machinery. Signs of occupation. The old Mellifluan buildings are dwarfed by the megastructure that the Saborians have only recently sealed into the rock face. But much of its glass is cracked, and some panes are missing entirely. Mining vehicles chug uniformly in and out of the hangars. \nLois cartwheels across the rubble, and scurries in through the squat door of the old lean-to. It used to be the main office of the mine, but it's token now. She hears voices, and quickly backs against the wall.\n",
        "\"I'm not sure there's a reason for you to be here anymore, is all.\"\nAn official voice, Saborian.\nBlood-red carpets swing from the ceiling, and the shelves are cluttered with copper urns and smoking apparatus. There are paper archives on several large and obsructive bookshelves whose dust show they are now seldom used.\n\n\"What do you mean, Durius?\"\n\"Well Okropir, preliminary readings show that if we dig beneath this office, we'll come across the biggest seam on the site.\"\nLois gets to the near aisle, and peeks at the two men through sand-coloured filing. The Mellifluan is bearded and diminutive, the Saborian is dressed in a stiff white uniform of which Alika's mantle is a copy.\n\"But this is not yours to demolish. Our agreement is supposed to be temporary, all of this is temporary,\" Okropir says.",
        "\"It's been agreed at a higher level. If we win the war, we bring prosperity to Melliflua, and everyone's happy. Look how efficient the mining has been since our arrival - when the war is finished you'll have plenty of Atlas.\"\n'That's if the war finishes. I've spent my whole life with these rocks, and I'm sick of them. I don't give a fig for Atlas. But this office is my office, and I won't let you touch it.\"\n\"Obstructing us? There are hundreds of mines like this in Melliflua. A one-man rebellion will make no difference to the war.\"\n\"Tis mine is near three-hundred years old, and I have worked here for forty-for years. You might think you have a tradition, but you don't. Your people have no culture, no history. You're blank as a page.\"\n\"You and your books Okropir. We'll let the Aetherium decide your fate, stubborn little winkle, or perhaps the bulldozer.\"\nThe Saborian turns to leave, but something keeps him there.\n\"Have you heard the stories of limbo?\" says the old Mellifluan, licking his lips, \"The mines. Armadas. War. Soon we will all be at the precipice, looking down over Limbo. Limbo is the end, my friend.\"\nDurius scoffs hollowly, and walks away. Lois shadows him around the shelves, until he is gone.\n\"Limbo is coming, I tell you!\" Okropir shouts after him.",
        "Before he knows it, Lois has Okropir at the deadly end of her gun.\n\"What do you want?\" he sighs.\n\"I need you to open the gate. I promise, it't for a good cause.\"\n\"You heard us talking?\"\n\"I did.\"\nSo, what's this for?\"\n\"It's for Melliflua. Make me a distraction at the gate. I need those Essedari on alert.\"\nOkropir nods, and Lois lowers her gun to her side. He walks slowly past, out of the old mining offices, and calmly across the compound. She watches from the window as he turns the crank, and the main gate begins to open. The godhands get to their feet in disbelief, rushing along the wall to challenge him.\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\"I was given an instruction buy the commander,\" he lies. The godhands tune into their radios.",
        "Meanwhile, Alika waits for the right moment. He chekcs his timekeep. She must be inside by now, he thinks. Menizes nods. Alika stands, straightens his uniform, and makes for the gate where the two Essedari have Okopir in custody. Alika had to shut this place down for good.\n\"I'm ahead of a road transit convoy,\" says Alika to the Essedari, whose visors are up. They see his uniform and stand to attention, \"so why are the gates being closed again?\"Alika hands over a telegram.\nRoad transit convoy approaching. Open main gate.\n\"We weren't expecting any delivery today,\" says the taller Essedari.\nAlika points up to their colleague on the tower. \"76 replied to say he received the message, and you'd be ready for us, and that someone would open the gates.\" The Essedari buzz up for 76 to come down. He engages his gymnothruster and descends rapidly. As he lands, the dust billows up beneath him. He lifts his visor, revealing a furrowed monobrow.\n\"Apparently you ok'd this message?\" says the taller Essedari.\n\"Not at all. Who are you anyway?\" he says to Alika. But Alika is looking up at the tower again, where Lois had already weighted anchor from the gunships and the stone transports, letting them drift crewless up into the clouds. The Essedari follow his gaze, and realising they have been tricked, unholster their pistols. But Alika already has them where he wants them. He pulls the fuel cord on the nearest gymnothruster, severs it, and diverts the the jet into monobrow's face, who chokes and falls. Before the other two Essedari can react, Alika has bashed their heads together and knocked them out cold.\n",
        "\"Take this,\" he says to Okropir, tossing him a gun. They are already under heavy fire, but Menizes is a crack shot, and has a vantage point beyond the fence. He picks off the best of them, and leaves the rest at the mercy of Alika and Okropir.\nWhen the last godhand falls, Alika seizes his chance, and signals to Menizes to bring the explosives. Haulage drivers stop, and climb out of their rollers. Good Mellifluan men and women. Alika tells them it's time for them to grab their stuff and leave.\nAlika winches Menizes and the explosives down the open shaft on the ropelift. When Menizes has set the charges, Alika winches him back up. Suddenly an alarm sounds from the main building. Lois emerges from the portcullis with Commander Durius at gunpoint ahead of her.\n\"I couldn't stop the alarm,\" she shouts through the haze of Atlas dust. A second wave of godhands who have heard the alarm have taken up positions around them. Shots are fired, and Menizes does his best to return them.",
        "The rebels take cover behind the lean-to.\n\"You won't get away with this,\" says Commander Durius.\n\"There's three of us, with no back-up. We never expected to,\" replies Menizes.\n\"Don't make me hurt you Menizes!\" yells Lois, \"I won't die here, and nor will you.\"\nAlika hangs his head. For once he sounds sincere.\n\"I'm sorry Lois.\"\n\"You!\" she says, aiming her gun at him.\n\"Had to be this way, and it had to be you Lois. I'm sorry.\"\nAt that moment the haulage rollers crash through the gate. Some of the godhands set off in pursuit of the rollers.\n\"Sorry never means anything form you, Alika,\" Lois says with feeling, \"now shut up, and let's get out of here.\"\n\"Well if we try by foot, we might stand a chance. We could hide in the canyon.\"\n\"No, I have a better idea,\" she says, grabbing Commander Durius in a headlock. If they could get through the command centre, and up to the docking platform, there would still be the one gunship waiting. She edges out from behind the lean-to, gun to Durius' head. The godhands cease fire.\nAs they cross the compound, hands twitch on triggers. Then one shot is fired, then two. The godhands know if Durius dies, he will ascend a hero. Shots rip into him and he lets out a final yelp.\n\"Run!\" Lois says, dropping the dead commander. Bullets come thick and fast as they make for the door. But Okropir isn't with them, instead he is running toward the guns.\n\"For Mellilfua!\" he cries. Then he staggers, blood runs down his beard, and he drops, dead in the dust."

I reached for the blob, and it extinguished. There was something soft in my fist. I opened it, and saw a pudgy little worm there. It glowed much fainter, perhaps to play dead. I put it on the ground, and Una sniffed it. When we walked away, it effervesced brightly again. A grotto opened out beyond. There were thousands more of the worms ahead, whole constellations of them. The grotto floor grew pointed teeth like jaws, and the walls oozed sulphur.\nA subterranean river met us. Una and I walked alongside, watching it twinkle slow and tranquil. Then Una leapt in, and realising how cold it was, leapt out again, shaking off the water. We followed it until it drained away through a hole, which echoed as if the water has a long way to fall.",
        "\"Screeeeeeee.\"\n\"Hello?\" I said, into the dark.\n\"Screeeeeee!\"\nIt was something off to my left, and getting closer. I thought about ducking under the water, but it was too shallow. Una growled and looked to me for guidance.\n\"Screeeeee!\" it said, stepping into the light.\nBeneath a chandelier of glow-jars to my left was a thing. It was hairless, pink, and scaboid. Perhaps half my height, its oval face was dominated by a huge pair of front teeth. Its red eyelids were sealed shut, and its body was a stooping column of creased and freckled skin. Curved spurs protruded from its feet and hands, and a wispy black garmnt draped from its breast.\n\"Screeeeee!\" I said, hoping it would understand. It tilted its head quizzically, sniffing at Una, before advancing towards me purposefully.\nI was so transfixed, that I remained completely still until the buck-tooth monster was at my side. It pulled my arm as if to lead me somewhere. Dazed, I followed. Reluctantly, Una came too, protesting my lack of resistance with a snarl.\n\"Screeeee!\"\nI looked at the hand that gripped. The Envoy's skin was translucent. We were led along a passage dotted with jelly lamps until we reached a pleasing and homely burrow.",
        "The Envoy stood on his back legs, and with one outstretched paw, presented me with a black tabard like the one it wore. At the center of the tabard, the material was darker, and shaped like a plait. The Envoy tried to fit one on Una too, but she barked and frightened him away.\nThe Envoy joined its friends, who were huddled on one side of the burrow, while Una and I remained on the other. It was cold, but I couldn't make a fire what with the thought of the smoke, and not knowing if they would tolerate it. I thought the least I could do was don the tabard, at which there was a delighted chattering of teeth. The creatures faced me for a moment, before bundling up again. They were uncommonly ugly. Una and I closed up and tried to sleep.",
        "I dreamed of my brother Azrudin, and the Palace of the Old Kings falling into the void.\nI woke abruptly to violent screeching. There was a nauseating smell. I was freezing, there was no light at all, and I couldn't feel Una.\n\"Screeeeee!\"\n\"Nehhhhhhh!,\"\n\"Screeeeee!\"\n\"Nehhhhhhh!.\"\n\nI scrambled to my feet, and followed the screeching. It seemed to grow further away at first, and then louder. Then I saw a pale light and followed it. It turned out to be an abandoned jar, glass cracked, and its worm wriggling away. I picked up the worm and held it between my fingers, so that I could see the outline of the passage ahead. As I walked, a chilling wing blew back my hair. The screeching grew lounder, and was joined by a swishing sound.\nFinally, round a corner, a great cavern opened up the size of a city. A fingernail of moonlight flood in from above, bathing a battlefield in blue, where thousands of the ratfolk clashed. There were the black tabards of the Envoy's faction, but at their throats, others who wore silver crowns cast in the shape of the plait. They swung thick throny banches ferociously at each other - that swishing sound. Then I saw Una, who was wearing one of the black tabards, gnawing the leg of a silver hat while he flogged her with a thorny cudgel.",
        "Several days after the battle, I had given up on trying to get the tabards, or Una, to find me a way out of the caves, and in hunger had been forced to eat a worm. It tasted ok. These invertebrates were so important to the ratfold, that I was convinced it must be what they were fighting over. Then there was the cold, and the constant darkness.\nAll things considered, I didn't want to spend the remainder of my life underground, and without Una to comfort me, regretted the moment I first stepped into the cave.\nNot wishing to dwell on the gloominess of it all, I took a handful of worms, and navigated my way back to the battlefield where I'd seen the moonlight streaming in. I looked longingly up at the oval of blue sky, wondering if the walls could be scaled. They couldn't. After some fruitless wanderings in the caves beyond, I trudged, exhausted, back to the burrow.\nThe burrow was deserted. I pottered on through ante-chambers, low-ceilinged vaults filled with glow jars and earthen pots, seeing no-one. Finally, at the far side, I came upon a room with a furnace, and I chimney leading to the surface. At least if I was stuck here, I'd have somewhere to keep warm, I thought. The furnace was part of a machine that manufactured all of the little jars to hold the worms. One of the tabards was next to it, sifting sand between here paws into a silver funnel.",
        "I heard a bark, and found Una and some of the tabards in the room beyond. They were digging a watery pit for worms. I tried to help out, but my blunt fingernails were poorly-suited to the task. We struck a layer of yellow clay, and tired of digging, I began to model it in my fingers. It turned into an old-fashioned boat, but the sails I made were too heavy and drooped off their masts.\nThen I made a plait shape, just like the ones on the tabards. I lifted it up to the glow-worm lamp to admire my efforts. All of a sudden, I became aware of an expectant silence, the scrabbling had stopped, and the tabards were gathered around me, noses twitching. In spite of their poor eyesight, they must have been able to see the silhouette of the clay against the light, and were admiring it.\n\"Screeeeee!\" the envoy cried."

      "Meeting Metal": [
        "I was told the only warlock who'd meet me Outside of a sand circle was on sabbatical in the deep dark recesses of Koinos. Not the eastern Pekoe region. but the overgrown snake-infested belly. which even in this intrepid age remains uncharted.\nI had six trim Bandini to carry the bags, a hardy pack beast (who in the end we were forced to return to the skyship as he found the going too uneven). and at the front the small consortium who'd plan our progress beyond the bald promontory upon which we'd landed.\nI'd been told to meet the warlock of the Metal at the Shrine of Owls. but that we'd have to navigate there on foot. A tramp beneath the trees. where vegetation scored our arms like black glass. As we set off, the Bandini formed a shield around us, beating the undergrowth to out the vermin snake the locals call \"Twy-ni-Banda\". These serpents are so numerous. and their bite so toxic, that there was every chance we wouldn't make it.\nSure enough, on the very first day, a Bandini was bitten between the toes. Enduring his screams, we comforted him through to the end knowing there was nothing to be done. when he was dead. we lit a pyre. Even the Twy-ni-Banda seemed to keep a respectful distance from the fire, until a squall came and washed it out and we were forced to hurry on.",
        "After three days of fitful sleep in the boughs of the trees (it is lucky the snakes rarely climb) and swimming under improbable waterfalls, we found the shrine. A glittering line of seventy-one lshgiruans were waiting expectantly for us on the steps. We embraced them firmly, both because it seemed the honourable thing to do, and also because we were so utterly relieved.\nMetal wore the suitably inappropriate; an encumbrance of currency threaded around the neck, a heap of skin-piercing jewellery in his ears and an Empress-green and gold skirt hat he trailed in the dirt. Metal argued that by corollary of its length and thick lining, the skirt acted as defence against the Twy-ni-Banda, of whom all present parties were understandably terrified.\nThe Shrine of Owls, I am told, is more than five-thousand-years-old. By the two moons, that is long before Sabor came into being. Metal believes, to a fault, that the lineage of the Empress is at least as ancient.Still, a study of the shrine kindled a connection for him. He said, \"it is no coincidence we lshgiruans also hold owls, hawks and peregrines in similarly high regard.\"\nI myself had the eerie feeling that I knew the place, yet had never been there. It seems to confirm the Gall view that Koinos was home to us all once.",
        "Thankfully the Shrine of Owls is a haven from the ungodly snakes. There is a moat around it, and the snakes are not keen swimmers. Whoever built it must have known.\nThe meeting seemed a mutually profitable exchange, for the Warlock of Metal said he was much enthused by Saborian life, and that he longed the Unity might one day become so uniform and fair. I provided an explanation of how that could be achieved, but he quickly snubbed me, remarking that our system was \"quite extreme\".\n\"I fear it is just not the way things are. You see, the Empress has special and ancient bonds. The Book of Soil says her reign must continue, or our race will uncoil, and the separate strands of the rope wither and grow weak,\" he said.\nHe did explain however, that following his residency here in the forest, he was hopeful that a generous sum might scatter from the Empress Tarramaggi's pockets and cascade down upon her extended family like a water fountain.\nHe had a merchant with him, Nabob Tyrese. A man whose only fondness was for eating. He refused to walk anywhere, and it was infuriating to discover the both of them had actually been winched down into the forest from a skyship, rather than (as I had been led to believe) making the arduous trek, which had cost my own caravan so dear.\nA fine banquet was prepared for us, a long table in the lshgiru style filling the grand hall at the top of the steps.\"Tyrese is here to see if this land has prospects,\" said Metal.\"I see,\" I said, curiously, since I had a similar errand to run on behalf of the Sabor Assembly.\"There\u2018s nothing here,\" said the Nabob dismally, as he chewed a cube o cold butter, \"only stinking snakes.\"\"We hope that our skyship may return shortly, for we have had our fill of the wild,\" said Metal.Not enough women,\" smirked the blotchy-faced Tyrese.",
        "\"We must elevate Ten-Rui to the status of the Saborian cities\", said Metal over dessert.\nI wasn't so sure it could be done.\n\"There is no such thing as a \"citizen\" of the Kioki Unity,\" he laughed, \"All are welcome in Ten-Rui, but they must make their own way. Success is only equivalent to effort!\"\nI looked at Metal and wondered if he or his friends had ever had to work to get by. But there was no arguing with them.\nLater, Metal showed me a strange thin with flower stamens. He put them in water, and they dyed it yellow. He dipped his finger in and stirred, then he daubed it upon my cheeks, and said I was now \"in the Karem style\". I was promptly asked for a sizeable donation to their cause, which I felt I ought not refuse. I found myself signing off a shipment of myrrh against my book of entitlement.\nlncredulous I said, \"Metal, these magikal arts of yours are little more than a sham.\"But he laughed again. As long as he was paid, he could never take offence."

Landscapes dashed with bold strokes of colour. By 2850, the sylph movement had begun, and like many artists I'd begun to depict the tiny people that inhabit everything. My landscapes became backdrops, the little sylphies floating across the foreground, spangling the lake creatures with their aetherial shimmer, as such agents of Aetherium are wont to do.\nBy then, the Momoros scene was flourishing, and I met visitors from all over Foundation. The abstracts from Melliflua, illustrators of the Verduban muscular school. Once we had learned all they had to teach, they were sent home, and we plastered the walls of Momoros with mimicry of their styles. It was a great time, and I met a beautiful girl. She was slender like a sylphie and I fell in love.",
        "But love took me to a dark place, for the sylphie betrayed me. She took another in the Boros. How hard it was to ascend after that. How horrible a distraction from my painting. And of course, there was no sympathy. That was not the Saborian way.\nBy then the Boros had got out of hand. The Committee even closed the Boros for a while, said there were too many of us, but it was too late for me. I never saw my sylphie again.\nNow if I sit before the lake, brush in hand, I don't see sylphies, I see her face, and I can't paint."

She was born high in the Kioki foothills to Karem parents. She developed quickly, becoming an avid reader and inquisitive young scholar. Aged eight, she was accompanied by her parents to the Gwendolier institute, in the hope that she might gain admittance. If the entrance examinations are gruelling now, they were more so back then. But being a prodigious talent, she sailed through.\nHaving graduated from Gwendolier to Panyana, she received the golden locust as a prize for her early flourishes (the locust represents Small, god of youthful voracity). She was known for her commitment to both study and the gods, and could be seen kneeling before the sacred arches at daybreak. She kept iconography of the goddess Icthuna above her bed, and her room at Panyana is not a small museum to her memory, serving as an example to new students of good organisation and focus. It remains a neat, sparsely-decorated room just as it was in her day, which leaves us with the few clues as to the real person behind the science. Those who spend time with her remembered her;\n\"She never seemed to need any help with her work, almost to a fault she would pride herself on doing it her way.\"\n\"Alcibiana was my best and worst student. We may never know half of the things she came up with, the theories she left unfinished when she died.\"",
        "It was as if she ignored the acclaim, the prizes, for her discovery of Atlas' properties. Instead she tried to form a unified theory or Foundation's construction. She was never content, never finished. For the rest of her life until her untimely death, she worked feverishly to understand the electrical changes that she claimed existed beneath Foundation's surface. Astonishingly, given the meticulousness of her early career, Alcibiana only wrote a handful of these calculations down.\nIt is said she would lock herself away for hours on end, refusing to ead. It was later discovered (and there is still a chute there today) that she spend much of this time with a spade, digging down as far below Panyana as she could. This explained the many heavy bin bags she would leave outside her room for the maids.\n\"She seemed to stop doing conventional experiments after a time, becoming obsessed with more and more implausible theories, with seemingly no practical examples in nature. Nevertheless she strove to recreate them in the confines of her study, as evidenced by the tunnelling, the manifold materials and machinery. Some say she let success go to her head. I agree, although not in the way they mean it.\"\nTragically she passed away of malnourishment at the age of twenty-seven. Some believe she was a reborn follower of the Saborian creed, and her efforts were part of a scheme to join Aetherium. Her grave overlooks the University, just beyond the arches of the deities of Gall. There are always fresh flowers upon it, and it is just as common to see Gall's young students and supplicants here, as it is to see them at the arches of their gods."

        "<Carved roughly>\nI used to pick up Mantas when I was little. You could clean their gills, and pet them, and they didn't seem to mind. My older sister was horrified when I told her what I'd been doing. But once, a Manta bit off a piece of my finger, and I knew things would never be the same. If I sight a cloud of them now, I know to steer the other way.\nIt makes me sad that they are angry at us. I suppose the Mantas are only defending themselves. All of us are desperate, knowing everything could be a threat, or if not, prey. At least if we find friendship, it can help us feel part of something."

      "No Glove Lost": [
        "We didn't quite get the promotion come the end of the year, but I scored so many points and assists that someone was bound to come knocking. I was offered a choice, Darat Miners, who'd gone straight back up to the big league or, champions Darat City.\nI knew I wouldn't start for the City, and since my dad had been a miner, I picked the underdogs. Years later I met the King, and he asked why I didn't pick Darat City. Obviously I didn't tell him the real reason, so I told him about my dad instead. I remember he said I was \"quaint,\" and that I \"wouldn't have fitted in anyway.\"\nMy last season was the 2950 campaign. By then I held all the records, and the miners had aced the title fourteen times, more than any other team.\nI was still the main man in the Bandinian national team. But the cup in 2950 left a sour taste in the mouth. A lot of people were hanging around the team at the tournament in Melliflua, and it didn't help us one bit. There was a lot of money changing hands, and a lot of our players weren't on great money.\nOn the court the big moment was in the first game, when the umpire, a Saborian, kept giving fouls against us. Obviously we complained, but rumours were going around about us by then, and the organisers ignored the complaint. After that we were fighting a losing battle, and Bandinia didn't make the second round for the first time on record. The Mellifluans had a pretty good team, and 'though they had nothing on us, they ended up winning it in the end."

        "We disregard worldly things. Skyships have no place here, nor Atlas trinkets and baubles. We will not tolerate Ishgiru jewels or extravagances. Nature has brought us together for a purpose, our minds must be uncluttered. The dome is our one indulgence, it controls the four winds, it is an extension of Malagawny himself.\nMalagawny cleanses us. If you pass through his body, your history is cleansed. You are born again. a Green Islander, just as I was. Many who arrive are exiles, criminals, but we don't judge them, or speak further on it. Some leave as quickly, or find this way of life not to their liking. But many more stay behind, and now we have families whose children have never been beyond the spout. From what we hear of Foundation, that can only be a good thing.",
        "We disregard the world beyond Malagawny. Through the years, the one thing that has remained constant is our love for the islands. These islands are not possessions, they have their own minds. The crown is where we reside, where shards of Atlas jut upward and give these islands their name. The orb is where the sheep roam. The sceptre is long and thin. In all these years, I can't say I've covered every blade of grass, but perhaps before I die, I will see the hot springs again, the lake of tar. It is getting harder to make those journeys. Of course, you are not permitted to go to the spirerock cave. An unspeakable witch-woman lives there, commanding spirits to do her bidding with magicks from her books.",
        "We disregard religion. We will have no religion brought here to contaminate our love. No sudden warlockery. Nalagawny, for example, may be strange and wonderful, but is no god. It is a part of nature. A man came here from Verduba, he said the Ice god was the only way. In the end he drove himself mad trying to convince us. I had the others tie his arms and legs with heavy bags of sand. Each had a small corner cut away for the sand to escape gradually. When after five days his hands were worn from struggle. but enough sand had emptied that he could move again. he agreed not to speak of his Ice god again. One night he simply took a boat and leftto peddle his lies elsewhere."

        "Said the supreme Prince Ursulus, \"Saddle a wild cat to transport me to Agbana, for I wish to meet this princess. I intend to marry her, and to bond our peoples to theirs.\"\nThese were the days when power rested in the hands of the few, and such behaviour was common. Ursulus rode the wild cat for a month throu h the green pastures of the north. He took in the sights of he country, and the work of his people, whom he called the \"Pilipai', since they were happy to live outside the city. His entourage of fifty men and women saw to his every whim.\nAt the end of the fourth week he arrived in Agbana, anxious to see the foreign princess about whom all the people had remarked. Ursulus invited her to his private parlour, so that he could propose. Awaiting her were great citrus cakes, and game pies, and carafes of the finest wines, and a golden chequerboard table for the feast to rest upon. But when the princess arrived, supreme Prince Ursulus spewed his wine down his best toga.\nThe foreign princess turned out to be a gigantic rat, with\nthe bushiest bulging cheeks, and the sleekest pinkest ears.",
        "What Ursulus did not know, was that the princess had survived the terrible voyage. With her remarkable ingenuity she managed to construct a makeshift boat from a sail and beam of the old one. Once returned to the Wahsili, the story of the prince's deception quickly spread, and the Wahsili vowed to rise above the selfishness and cruelty of humankind. The rat clans met in the great burrow beneath the moon, and agreed to a pact of peace.\n\"The Wahsili shall no longer fight over the Lighter of the Lamps. Nor shall they squabble over the prophecies of Envoys, who say the cavern shall shatter. The cavern-beneath-the-cavern hears us, and we must remain humble.\"\nSome of the clans objected to the lack of \"sport\", so it was agreed that the battles themselves should continue, but that no rat should be allowed to come to harm. If you ever chance to visit the burrow in your travels across Foundation, put your ear to the soil, and you may hear the rumble of sword on board, as to this day, the rat-people commemorate the return of their princess."

How the hulks blotted out the sun, and the storms threw everyone about so they couldn't even see.\nBut the thing that he let slip that clenched my fists, was that Sabor could have surrendered, he insisted, the war began.

We are god.\nAt very short notice, some two weeks ago, I was reassigned to the Stalk. To what purpose I could not fathom, since I am expert in ship-to-ship communication, not politics.\nI vowed to make the best of it, and was surprised to find that morning, a large number of similarly baffled new recruits were gathered in the lobby. We speculated as to why the sun hadn't come out for months.",
        "A very brief and jittery address was given by a former colleague of mine, Captain Mirro. He told us something utterly unexpected. He said the Stalk was a flying machine, much like a skyship, and that we were going to be crewing it into battle. He seemed unsure how this would be possible until Admiral Methusan arrived.\nMethusan was, by contrast, cocksure. He took us up to the separation point at the 24th floor, and revealed a hidden panel behind a portrait of Utopian Zubin. He solved a combination, and a door opened to a windowed gallery full of antiquated looking controls and devices, where a Pilipus was already busy brushing the cobwebs away.\n\"This will be your new ship,\" Methusan said, \"time to show we lead from the top.\"",
        "Premier Telemon could see from our faces that other questions needed answering before the Committee could count on our loyalty. He gently moved Methusan aside.\n\"Thank you, Admiral,\" he said. His face was plump and his eyes sunken. Not at all like the photographs. He had a shocking clump of white hair at either temple, and a shamefully portly frame.\n\"Many of you will believe that I, Telemon Aristei, who now enteres his seventy-third year, should long since have risen. You, or someone you know, will have held a placard calling for me to be stripped of citizenry. I accept your challenge, I do. But knowledge has become a problematic thing for us Saborians. Someone has needed to carry the torch, to pass our essence on to the next generation. It was agreed by unanimous vote that person should be me.\"\nHis words tamed us, and before long we were taking instructions the way all good Saborians do.",

Few of us had seen action at the front, and those who had, said it was never like this.\nA whole Kioki ship immolated. A burning man running across deck, flinging himself overboard so it could all be over. The Kioki force was ragged, but thick. Thousands and thousands of vessels, none build the same as the last, each the servant of the monied of Ten-Rui. The smell of power filled the air.\nTo the right flank, directly above the skirt of the abyss, our Essedari thrust their way toward a Kioki Heavy Freighter belonging to a Lark birgade. But several other Lark ships came running and closed ranks.\nWe turned our cannons upon the Sky Hulks, which drudged the cloudy expanse like the monstrosities that they were.",

Rumour spread from one of the Essedari ships that the Empress herself was aboard othe Kioki flagship.\nHer fleet ploughed towards us demented, deranged. We fought them off bravely for a time, but there were just too many, too fast.",

The wing whistled through, blowing papers and everything else overboard. Then the aft propellers cut and we lurched. The upper disc slid off and over us like a fried egg on a pan.\nIt fell - the committee chamber, the assembly chamber - silently into the deep. I could have sworn I saw Telemon pressed against the glass, looking beyond us to the Aetherium. Perhaps in that moment he knew, not ascending but descending, what if felt like to be betrayed.\nThat is the last I recall.\nWait, no, there's a moment more, just before freefall.

        "Mo trudges on, and the air clears as the road winds up towards the chalk valley, where the hundred-thousand fell. At night, I've heard that phantoms drift gally among the buried, talking happily as if they had never been slain. They speak a language few of us, their progeny, can follow.\nThe soldiers' old belongings are still trapped in the earth, though I pray they are never disturbed. They are cursed, and it is said if those treasures are displaced, a terrible sandstorm will descend from the mountains upon Darat, and the city will be consumed.",
        "It is a moon or two later. We're atop the Mount of Plenty, walking around the lake. The waters are so broad, I can't see the other side, and I feel calmed. This is the source of the river Redu, on which Redusa relies. I let Mo drink, soft and sloppy, then we eat, rest, and I refill the decanter. There's folds of travertine on the water's near side, which have naturally formed a tiered garden of ponds. Their low walls are bright green from Atlas. It's easy to catch a few fish, and cook, and I find the roof of a mausoleum part-submerged. Once-holy text babbles along the wall, and continues out of sight beneath the tide of travertine. From where we stand and onwards out to the floodplain beyond, right up to where the river bursts into the delta, the desert dies, and all is lush and verdant green. Redusa is but a silver spectre on the horizon. This is now as far as I have ever been, but I've still a long way left to go.\n",
        "The river's broad and split. Mo's hooves slosh over the orange clay path. I see a rising place overhead. A ship is moored there, and a ritual's a-go.\n\nA strange thing, the Saborian way, I can't recommend it. We should enjoy life as long as we can, who can know, or have proof there is anything beyond it? Yet they are so convinced, they take off to the grave early. If I were Saborian I'd be long gon, since I am old. But by small and token joys, I am more content and happy now than I have ever been. My journey will end when it ends, not when others decree it must.\nI tether Mo at the base of the beehive, and eavesdrop upon the gathered crowd. A man, then summers greener than I, is readying himself for the rising place.\n",
        "On the approach to the city of Redusa, bevvies of boviaries are nursed by the sacred Redu, whose waters run milky-clear. The farmers here seem happy enough, if aloof. There is a thick smell of manure, and on the road, the horned creatures crowd Mo, in awe of his dankness. They look at his face, and they wonder, \"are you...are we?\" But Mo shifts around uneasily. The gaze of the milk-making beasts is too intense for him by a margin.\n\nWe trundle on to the residences stretching outwards from the city wall. They're all citizens here, because the border of Redusa grows outwards as well as upwards. A man on the back of donkey will turn heads, revealing sour, suspicious faces. If I'm to get out, I might have to leave Mo behind, or trade him. If I have something to sell, I can stowaway in a ship from the small skyport outside the walls. I won't get into the main one, not without going through the Godhands.\n",
        "We're in Fasio's fishing town, Mo and I. We had a long few weeks in Mellifluan country. Mo caught a splinter in the foot, and refused to budge. While he was recovering, I fell into the arms of a local girl. She would've been a beauty once, and most generous to an old sot. She asked me to marry her, but instead of saying yes, I said I was leaving, like I always do. Before you accuse, remember I make this undertaking for my mother, and must set everything else aside.\nI told this beauty I would never have a second chance. I told her I was headed for the Night Lands on account of my mother. She listened to what I had to say, then she left me. I later read in the press that she was proposed to another, but being well-versed in the language of love, I felt no pinch from it.\nHis ears are full of holes, and they itch because of the flies. But he is happy now we have reached Fasio, and the water of the bay laps his stumpy legs.\nHis rejuvenation gets the better of him, and he treads on a sailor's foot. As the owner, I am reprimanded , and having lately been at the tavern, protest a little too fiercely. There is a brawl, and I come out better off than my opponent, a man with a scar on his face. I haven't time to celebrate when I am whacked on the head, and out go the lights.",

Do you use it for firewood, and go without, or do you mend it, keeping it braced to its task?\nI therefore propose to the Committee, a greater involvement of the godhands in the provinces, and thus better discipline of the Pilipai. In addition, I suggest slackest Pilipai might share bread with Bandini prisoners until they are able to see what a hard life is really like. Thank you. We are gods.\""

      "Terminal": [
        "The dorm is dark, and I began to wonder if I have taken a wrong turn. I inch inward, looking for a switch. Suddenly there is a roar, and the lights come up. I see a platoon of wicked faces. Music starts up on the player, and someone yanks my trousers down to the ankles. Hands tear at my top, despite my best efforts to hold on. Then, I am awash with oil, and bundled to the floor. Just as I am about to be crushed by the weight of many muscular bodies, they relent.\n\"What is this?\" I moan with my head still pressed to the soft matting. I feel the heat of an expectant silence. I sit up and wipe lubricant from my eyes. Looming over me is a brute about seven feet tall, and almost as broad. He looks as hard as a bronze statue. I only know he's alive because of his twitching plate-like pectorals.\nThe crowd form a natural arena, and I watch aghast as the ogre reaches into the bucket for a mighty palmful of the gunk, which he then proceeds to smear liberally over himself. Then with the same crane-like hand, he lilts me up, and throws me back down with a crunch. Through the sickening dizziness, a sense of injustice wells up in me. I'd have to show spirit, or I'd be forever known a coward. I roll through the giant's legs, and from behind, hook a kick up between them. He immediately drops to the floor clutching himself, wheezing.\nThere is a horrified gasp around the room.\n\"What's your problem?\" says a guy, placing a comforting arm around the oily monster, who has begun to sob.\n\"You're supposed to just take the hit,\" a punchy girl says, \"everybody knows that.\"",
        "Of course, the incident stuck with me. I quickly discovered that being from Agbana was a disadvantage. I hadn't been primed for service like the Redusans, they seemed to have spent their lives building up to it.\nI had few allies in my first week. Strangely though, the giant - whose name was Arnau - became a firm friend. I discovered that he himself, though complicit in my initiation, was roundly regarded as a buffoon. His size belied a gentleness that our first encounter would never have had me believe.\n\"Shall we eat?\" He'd say.\n\"Sure,\" I'd say.\nWhen not eating, most of the day was spent in the gym, which suited me well enough. I'd been one of the few to climb the Apotheon in Agbana, and physically, I had a bit of everything. I sometimes heard mutterings that the Redusan Apotheon was harder, but I knew it was the locals dirt-talking me.",
        "About halfway through the second week, I underwent an \"aptitude interview\".\nI was shown up to a room in the Stalk. Through the think glass, it was possible to see the wheels of Redusa, the spokes branching out of each sector, without hearing the hum of the machine.\nI only saw the thick neck, at first. Then, as the interrogation began, he spun around. His faceguard was a grander version of my own, with jagged black and red blades. When he turned to the side I could see his shaven head, and his flabby shoulders hunched forward like a dog's.\n\"I am Overseer Bulgus. Five questions, same as the others. Don't answer wrong.\"\nHe bounced his fist on the deck, and the five pips of authority rattled on his cuff.\n\"The first. If I walked you to the rising place right now, a gun against your head, could you ascend?\"\nI licked my cracked lips.\n\"I could.\"\nThere were scars across his shins and calves. His frame was squat and meaty.\n\"The second. I was born a Bandinian. How can I be a citizen of Redusa, and a citizen of Sabor?\"\nI paused. No Bandinian was ever a citizen.\n\"Because you're lying, Overseer,\" I said.\nThe mask turned sharply to face me.\n\"Third. What assignment do you dream of?\"\nI had prepared, and knew the only answer I could give, even if I did not entirely believe it.\n\"All assignments are equal, Overseer.\"\n\"So are you saying you won't enjoy it?\"\nThat wasn't one of the official questions I had prepared for.\n\"I will enjoy it. I enjoy work, wherever I am placed.\"",
        "\"Stop toeing the line, and speak your mind man! You will, as a godhand, enjoy it. You will enjoy feeding Bandinian rebels the fingers of Verduban protesters. You will enjoy burning their houses down, and you will enjoy making Sabor great again. It says here you were a soldier-\"\nHe prodded the paper with a fat finger.\n\"-but I don't see it. You've lived like a dead man, and if you don't start coming to life, I'm going to have to beat you into life. If the gods can't do enough to keep our cities pure, we need citizens on the ground carrying out their will, not shirkers and quitters.\"\n\"Yes, Overseer.\"\nBulgus straightened the toga beneath his blue plate armour.\n\"Do you accept, that as a godhand, no other assignment will be open to you, until the day of ascension?\"\n\"Yes, Overseer.\"\n\"Lastly. Do you agree to serve Sabor, no matter what order you are given?\"\n\"Yes, Overseer.\"",
        "l was haunted by the notion that I'd be stuck as a godhand until ascension. My reservations about the assignment grew, and I began to wonder if I'd ever see things the same.\nAfter the sewer episode, we were sent on elevator duty. As the main access points to the city from the ground, it was important experience for us. The elevators took up people, but also food grown outside of the city by the Pilipai. Their blood was as Saborian as ours, and some had even been citizens once, but lately, their lives had changed.\nThe cities wanted more from farmers every year. If there was a poor harvest, when they'd paid their tithe, there'd be nothing left to feed their families. It was part of our job to ensure that these Pilipai met their quotas, or soon it'd be the citizens who suffered instead.\n\"Come! Gather round, ask your children to each collect a fruit. It is a reward for all you have done for us,\" I lied.\nThe children of the Pilipai rushed from their parents' sides to the table, desperate for the dripping-ripe fruit. As soon as they were close enough, we snatched hem up and held them captive.\n\"Return in seven days with your tithes, or your children shall be put to work in the mines, and forevermore treated with the disdain afforded a Bandini,\" I read from memory. I couldn't look them in the eyes. These were good, honest folk, not criminals like the Bandini."

      "The Buccaneers of Vinicoti": [
        "The Buccaneers of Vinicoti (Abridged)\nTranslated from the original Mellifluan by Banton, a rammybobble survivor.\nI have been entreated by my dear Chabuti friends, Dr. Dvangeti (now sadly departed) and the man I gravely misjudged, Captain Gerundin, to relate to you the happenings on the isle of Nicobocar, all those years ago. It all began with the arrival of a carnival, their chequered sails hoving into port, and every Fasio louse creeping out from beneath his log.\nI remember as if it were yesterday, how Dr. Dvangeti, standing at my father's bedside, described the scenes at the pier, and that my father gave a disapproving nod. Fool youth that I was, I remained in the room only half as long as was polite, before rushing down the stairs and bursting out of the front door.\nThe pati-pikks squawked, and the tom-drummers rattled. The nanban smoked on their griddles and the dancing girls smirked. Fire sticks whorled like bodies of the heavens, and every distraction bore a whiff of danger. Wanting to assert my sophistication, I was quickly drawn to the throwing bar. A single concon was perched at the far end, and a scrawny man was distributing sets of three polished wooden throwing balls at the near. I remember his hat filled me with terror, for it was just the kind of black hat a nefarious man would wear, buckled grimly around the middle, and rather too upright in its manner. His left eye was trying to escape its socket, and the right already had.",
        "Above the bar was an ornate pair of pizzles, flinted and gilded, the star prize. I paid, was given my three balls, and took up position. I was so eager to claim the guns, that my first throw missed by a wild margin, thudding against the rug behind the concons. Realising I was being watched by a small crowd, I was determined to appear more calculated with my second shot. The resulting throw lacked instinct, and even before the moment of release I knew the ball did no desire to hit its mark. The crowd groaned, but goaded me on for my final attempt.\nWith this, the third, I was so convinced the feat could no be achieved, that I threw with more liberty again. In doing so, my throw achieved the perfect balance. The wooden ball planed sweetly through the air, and with a sharp crack, the concon-king was deposed. There was a great cheer, and the one-eyed stallman hawked and spat on the straw carpet.\n\"Wellun, boy,\" he said, in the most grudging possible tone, \"pick ee reward.\"",
        "The spectator drew his rapier, and lurched suddenly toward the stall man, who raised his own scimitar and deflected it. It is these brief moments I still dream of some nights, such were their lasting significance. Seeing my chance, I reached up and siezed the pair of pistols I'd longed for. I frantically primed them as well as I knew how, and lined up the skeletal stallman in my sights. As a matter of honour I'd decied I must vouch for the man who had some to my aid.\nThough my champion was fit and strong, and must have fancied his chances against a skinny one-eyed man, it became clear that there would only be one winner of the duel. Seeing the nimble and well instructed movements of the fearsome stall man, and being unable to muster the courage, and sank backward into a crowd of bodies. They had rushed from up and down the pier to see the fight, and being so small I had to squirm my way through. When I finally broke through their ranks, I heard a piercing yelp from the arena behind me, and knew at once my champion had fallen.\n\"Where are me guns ye maggot?!\" I heard the one-eyed knave cry, and I sprinted home, as fast as my legs could carry me.",
        "The next few days and weeks, I presumed to conceal my winnings. I had stowed them away in the armoire, and when my studies were done of a morning, I'd open the bottom drawer and peek beneath the handkerchief I'd covered them with. Oh how I adored the delicious metalwork - which on both guns depected bustling crabs and bony dice. My stupidity even extended to looking down the barrels in the hope of some insight as to why I found these tools of death so fascinating.\nMuch to my father's surprise, I did not once return to the carnival at the pier, and instead remained resolutely indoors. Clearly he was prepared to forbid me from returning to the carnival once he'd realised it was something I might actually enjoy, and was greatly disappointed that I now denied him the opportunity to express his authority.\nDr. Dvangeti's noticed father's general surliness, and put it down to a lack of fresh air. Father was prescribed a wheeled chair, and sent away to a retreat in the mountains to pick wildflowers. It left mother and I ad odds, for she lacked the same licence in enforcing my studies, and made weak threats to report my lack of application to father. But just when I had forgotten the incident that kept me away from the carnival, it surfaced again in the most unnatural fashion.\nIt was a dark omen my mother discovered that night. A crab the size of a dog, pinned by a knife to our family door. She rightly assumed this to be some mischief I had brought about, and dangled the poor crab in from of my face.\n\"What is this?\"\nI looked at the vulgar blade which scarcely protruded from its chell, and sweated at the thought of the force with which it must have been thrust. The one-eyed man come for revenge. I mumbled something to mother, and rushed to my room to check the pistols were still there.",
        "The rain lashed the bay, and Fasio glowed behind me as I ran. There were five of them, maybe six. I heard the shattershot of a pizzle and I saw a puff of fire. There was a whistle, and bark split from the trees ahead. I kept to the shoreline and ran hard. If I stayed low, there was every chance they'd lose me. But then my ankle turned on the sand, and I fell.\n\"Hold it there boy.\"\nThey were too close to miss. I turned and cocked my pistols, training them on anything I saw move. One-eye stepped out from behind a tree, the water dripping from his mangy beard.\n\"Your flints are as damp as a hound's licker. And if that weren't enough, they're sham pizzles! They're for show boy, do you hear?\"\nI wept as those words, and there was a peal of laughter from the trees ahead and behind. I couldn't see them, but they were there.\n\"Hand'em over, and you'll live, boy.\"\nI got to my feet, and stepped gingerly over to one-eye, holding out the guns by their pommels.\n\"Thank you kindly,\" he said. They he signalled, and I was snatched and bound by one of the ruffians.\n\"What'll we do with him, Potty?\" one of them said.\n\"You said I'd live,\" I managed, before the gag was fully over my mouth.\n\"Not your kind of livin'!\" cackled Potty, and they took my aboard their skyship.",
        "By admitting my resistance was broken, and that I was theirs to own, I managed to get off lightly. I sensed the presence of a young fellow like me had improved morale aboard ship, and the old dogs would ruffle my hair, or threw me bits of bread to watch me eat \"all uppity\". Still the manacles were a hinderance, and made cleaning the privy harder, so it was a proud moment when I was released and given a scrubbing brush for deck.\n\"One man broke the code,\" cackled One-eye, \"he usurps yer throne of muck.\"\nOne-eye, known as \"Potty\", still continued to kick me affectionately in the spleen when'er he passed by. I was surprised to discover he was no more senior than the others. Stranger still, the pistols were not his, but belonged to the captain. who I was informed was not presently aboard.\nI had lost interest in the pistols. For one, they were to me, the cause of my present grief. Second, as Potty had been at pains to point out, they were never intended to fire a shot. Their purpose then, their significance? I did not think further on it since they had been locked away in Captain Skora's cabin.\nThe ship rocked down from the dusky clouds to the sweet isle of Nicabocar, where plumes of pipesmoke rose from bark rods, the Vinitotian girls sand, and the moth-bitten sailors chewed the corks from casks and tilted firewater down their gullets.",
        "That was the first time I saw him. What a different proposition to the others. Dressed in the attire of a Mellifluan painter, his sweeping beetle-red fabric light as air, he strutted up to the mooring like a piped riverhen. It turned out he had been ashore at Nicobocar for some time, and desired to debrief his crew on their nefarious reconnoitering. He beckoned from shore, and the crew sloped off to the inn.\nIf I ever wanted to get back home, I'd have to play along. Even so, I couldn't help but follow them to the inn when the asked me to stay put. I kept my distance, and once they were all inside, I crept up to the door to their meeting room, and opened it slightly. I peeked and saw Captain Skora float down upon his soft skirts. The other sailors gathered around him, mopping his brow, feeling his clothes, and combing his fashionably floppy hair. Potty did not join in the adoration, and sat awaiting his instructions with Kazimin, a gigantic man with tiny black eyes and a bloated steaming face. It wasn't long before the Captain got down to business.\n\"Clear away now, give us peace,\" said Skora to his crew, who as the left the inn, gibbered over the fine ornaments and clothes they had seen. Captian Skora whispered now, and I took the liberty of moving behind the ale trolley so as to hear.",
        "\"So, how did you come across them?\"\n\"The conconman had them, as you prophesied,\" said Potty.\n\"What did you do with his body?\"\n\"I slung it into the river,\" said Kazimin.\n\"Good and weighted down,\" said Potty, \"then we kept up the charade of stall-keeping until the carnival was concluded.\"\n\"We did have a further trouble...\" began Kazimin, but Potty slapped him roughly on the cheek, and the giant was quieted.\n\"Well where are they?\" said the captain, his great frilled sleeves flopping here and there.\n\"Just here,\" said Potty, unwrapping the wretched things from their 'kerchiefs and holding them up to the candle light. It hurt me to see their glimmer again.\nThe Captain pried them impatiently from Potty's grasp. \"Yes...hmmn...\" he said, running his finger over the golden filigree of the barrel and hilt. He lay one back-to-back on the table with the other. At that moment, it struck me what was odd about them. The numbers on the dice were not identical on both pistols.\n\"We head to the gaol tonight. We have what we need,\" said Captain Skora, placing the pistols on his table.\nI was still puzzling over the dice. Hoping to see them more closely, I wrenched over the trolley, only to topple a lewd tankard which spilled its liquor everywhere. The barwoman screeched and put here hands to her mouth. In an instant, Captain Skora had drawn his thin sword and was holding it to my throat.",
        "\"Who is this?\" he said, addressing everyone at the inn. He feigned surprise when Kazimin spoke.\n\"He's the trouble.\"\nKazimin gave Potty a victorious look.\n\"Then why is the trouble still trouble?\"\n\"I thought he'd be of use alive,\" said Potty, \"a cunning little swindler he is. One of us I'd add, if he were worked upon, and schooled in our ways.\"\n\"As Captain, I'd be the one to say..\" said Skora, turning the sword tip on Potty, \"..if he's right for us, wouldn't I?\"\nSomething like panic came over me, and I jumped between the Captain's legs, grabbed up his garmet on the near side, and tugged sharply as I scrambled out from the other. Skora went head-over-feet, and his sword rattled upward into the air. Kazimin and Potty both took cover as the blade somersaulted and stuck end-first in the floor.\nBy this time, I'd managed to get my hands on the mock pistols, and danced out the door.\n\nThis time I would not be caught so easily. I bolted into the trees behind the inn, and leapt upon the bough of a friendly-looking tree, scaling it as fast and high as I could. I caught my breath at the top. From the vantage point, I was able to see the thugs lead by the fragrant Skora. He frothed at them for their stupidity as the walked the sand, shining their lanterns vainly along the line of trees.\nI stayed in the tree long after they had gone back inside. By the light of the moon I looked at the two pistols.\n\n\nThere were five dice engraved on each. On the right, one, six, one, six, one. On the left six, one, six, one, six. I thought carefully. One totaled fifteen, the other twenty, was that significant? I looked inland were the jungle climbed toward the foothills, and when I fell asleep, I dreamt I was a monkey cavorting between the branches.",
        "The next day began with a violent storm, and I was flushed down from my tree. The raindrops swelled and smushed like fruit, and I dashed beneath a woodshed. It was full of spiders. Just as the rain slowed, I heard their voices carry.\n\"I guarantee it is remembered sir,\" said Kazimin presenting a bent reddish fruit, \"I have scored it on the peel of this nanban.\"\n\"We will find the boy and the guns later then,\" said Skora, as the two emerged from beside the inn.\nWhere is Potty?\" Kazimin said, gormlessly.\n\"He is disgraced, and will lose this share. He mopes aboard ship, expecting forgiveness, when the plank is more likely. Come, we have much to do.\"\n\nThe Captain swaggered along a barley discernible path through the greenery. Kazimin slunk after him, and I in the rear, at a safe distance, so that my feet couldn't be heard. For half the morning we walked, as the sun drank the puddles. Then the going because steep and narrow. Stiff corridors of rock watched us by, and seed pods swung and burst their fluff in the air, which drifted and stung my eyes.\nFinally Captain Skora halted Kazimin at a high pass. A spit of a bridge periled over the chasm, where heavy plaits of water flowed.\n\n\"Do you have the nanban?\" he said.\nKazimin produced something from his pocket, and looking at it, suddenly became rather sheepish.\n\"Well? Hand it over!\"\nInto the Captain's hand, Kazimin placed the peel of the nanban he had eaten. The peel was brown and withered, and the cipher he had scratched on it now indistinct.\n\"You ate it?\" said Skora, bellowing/\n\"I had a hankerin' for breakfast,\"\n\"You lubbering boob!\" said Skora, hopping from one foot to the other.",
        "\"I can't be sure without it,\" said Kazimin, \"but it might be sixes and ones, ones and sixes.\"\n\"Six one, and half dozen of the other, eh?\" squawked Skora.\nThere was a rustling in the bushes, and the picaroons fell silent. Skora shushed Kazimin, and crept to a nearby bush, where he parted the leaves to reveal two faces staring back. The white faces were daubed in red paint, and they were carrying sharp pointed sticks.\n\"Oh hello,\" said Kazimin cheerfully.\n\"Hello,\" said she, the leader of the tribe, and stepped out of the foliage to lock arms with Kazimin in greeting, \"Come, this way.\"\nOff into the thickest part they went, and I followed, trying not to rustle. The land seemed to fall away either side to from a ridge. I smelt a meaty char, and saw a plume of smoke rising up ahead.",
        "Sweat overloaded my brows, and weeped into my eyes. The dwellings in the clearing, which comprised a series of extravagant stilted towers, were as well-made as any in Fasio. Each topped with a gold crest, in the shapes of ears, legs and eyes among other things.\nAt the centre of the village was a pit no more than five feet wide, over which Skora and Kazimin stood. It was surrounded by sharpened wooden stakes.\n\nSome instinct kept me back in the bushes. The whole scene wavered as if distorted by rising heat. I was right to be cautious, as it transpired that the whole village was before me, so well camoflaged and still, that they were almost invisible. I saw a flicker of movement here and there, and the hair stood up on my neck. The paint-daubed faces, silently watching the scene at the pit unfold.\n\"Captain Gerundin!\" said Skora, into the pit.\n\"I, not being amenable to scollybottoms and winkletinkers, refuse to have a dialogue with you,\" came a croaky, tired voice.\n\"Stop blathering. I have your pizzles now, and you are about to witness me opening your chest. Or should I saw.. my chest.\"\n\nKazimin stomped off to a tree, and dragged a great sea chest from beneath it. He brought it to rest at his master's feet. The conundrum of its clasped locks gleamed in the sun.\n\"Here Kazimin. What are the numbers?\"\n\"All ones and sizes, on both left and right,\" said Kazimin.\n\"Which on which one, in which order?\" said Skora.\n\"One then the other on both.\"\n\"Beginning with one or six?\" growled Skora, who was not beside himslef with anger.\n\"Aye,\" replied Kazimin, at which miscomprehension Skora saw fit to strike him heavily upon the nose. There was a bellow of laughter from the pit, and Gerundin stood up so I could just about see his haggard face. He was black with silver hair, an Ishgiruan. Never a more fearful-looking warrior had I chanced upon before, and thought it sensible they kept him contained.\n",
        "The night passed in waves. Whenever I awoke, I'd look over to the pit, and see Skora shaking Kazimin by the lapels, or threatening Captain Gerundin who laughed madly, or kicking the dust in exasperation. At one point, I heard a high-pitch chipping, and saw that Skora was hammereing away at the lock. But the lock was so sturdy it bore no mark, and then the natives came out of their dwellings to complain about the noise. From the signage of the elder tribeswoman, I understood she was also agitated because her people had not seen their side of a bargain. Whatever bargain it was, it seemed obvious that Gerundin was a part of it.\nBefore dawn I crept towards the camp. Skora and the faithful Kazimin had finally fallen asleep with their heads resting on the chest. That made it tricky for me to open safely, without disturbing them, and I had no intention of leaving the isle of Nicobocar without uncovering the plot.\nI mustered up some courage, and decided to gamble upon the fearsome warrior's predicament counting in my favour.\nAfter all, isn't an enemy's enemy, a friend?\n",
        "I made a noise like a cicada.\nCaptain Gerundin murmured sleepily from the pit.\n\"Psst\" I said.\n\"Gahh!\" he started loudly, then started up at me, eyes wide.\nWe listened nervously as his exclamation faded into the darkness.\n\"I will free you, but I will have your oath that you will help me escape this island,\" I whispered through the rows of tiny spines surrounding the pit. I had no inkling of how I would keep him to this promise.\nKazimin snorted suddenly, but did not awake.\nAfter a suitable pause, Gerundin spoke quietly in broken Mellifuan.\n\"Don't touch the spines. They're poisonous, and will turn your insides to mush.\"\nI moved my palms well away from the darts poking form the soil.\n\"How do I get you out?\" I said.\n\"Pull the thickest towards you,\" he gestured, \"no not that one. That one.\"\nI pulled the largest and to my surprise, it came free of the sandy soil. It was about three feet long. Its removal effected the collapse of an entire side of the pit, and the Captain was able to escape. The whole thing was wonderfully simple, and crucially, made very little noise. I could smell his rummy breath as he leaned down to me, and I wondered if I had made a mistake.\n\"Good work young man. I needn't ask why you're here,\" he said, glancing at the chest and back, and raising a white-grey eyebrow.\nOf course, I had no idea what lay within - some treasure perhaps. Immediately, I handed over the pistols presuming he know how to use them should his captors wake up.\n\"O-ho!\" he said, stifling his delight, \"just remember. One-six, six-one. That means run.\"\nWith a caring touch, he lifted the snoring Captain and his stooge Kazimin aside, and began forthwith to adjust the combination according to the numbered dice on the pistols. With a satisfying clack, each brace unclasped, and the Captain lifted the lid.\n",
        "\"It's empty,\" I whispered, looking at the red lining.\n\"It's O-PEN!\" shouted Gerundin into the night.\nThe alarm was raised. Within moments there was a general rattling, and then faces appeared beneath the lick of their torches. I felt cool metal bounce softly upon the nape of my neck, the two of us at the tips of their falcatas.\nFinally, the bleary-looking Captain Skora stood up, almost as astonished as I was at Captain Gerundin's daring. When he saw the open chest, he hurried over.\n\"I told you,\" said Gerundin smugly.\n\"What in Foundation! Where is it?!\" said Skora.\n\"It was never in there, it was always in here,\" he said, pointing at his temples.\n\"I don't believe you,\" he said.\nKazimin spotted me, but before he could strangle me, a mesh of falcatas came between us, and would not part for him.\n\"Heyy!\" he grumbled gormlessly.\nAt that moment, I felt a great deal more worried by the tribe that Skora and his lumber-brained aid. What was their stake in this? If the chest was empty, why had Gerundin not allowed us to escape when we had the chance? Wherever the treasure was now - for only treasure could draw such men to such a place - it must be highly desirable, and small enough to have fit into this sea chest.\n",
        "Gerundin pointed to a small patch of sand which, auspiciously, had recently been disturbed. The leader of the tribe promptly stood over it. \"No treasure until we get the Verdubans,\" she said. \"Oh no, quite right,\" said Gerundin cordially.\nA little way up the beach so that it was also visible around from the next bay, a fire was built of matted palm and all the sticks and branches that could be found. I gathered its purpose was to lure a Verduban boat. Much to his dismay, Kasimin's firewater was confiscated and used as fuel, and we all fell silent under the shade for several hours until the sun began to descend. I thought of running during those long hours, but to where? That's why I'd enlisted Gerundin's help, but to my dismay, he was proving himself to be just as selfish as the rest of them.\n\"A skyship!\" cried Kazimin. Sure enough it was. Two other vessesls followed. I could tell from the ear-shaped pring on one of the ship's pennants that it was the Verduban crossing we had been expecting. The fire had been enough to pique their interest, and they landed their vessel up the beach.\n\"By diplomacy I shall lure them out and into the jungle, where you can do with them as you see fit,\" said Gerundin. \"Bake them in the ground, slow-cook,\" said the leader of the tribe, licking her lips. \"Very good,\" said Gerundin nervously, holstering the fine pistols at his sides, \"I shall shortly return.\"",
        "\"We feel terrible,\" said the grey Verduban man I had seen talking with Gerundin.\n\"Please, it isn't necessary to apologise,\" I said for the umpteenth time. If they hadn't just saved my life, these Verdubans would be unbearable.\n\"No indeed, do not trouble yourself with what could have happened,\" said Gerundin smiling, \"think of what did happen - the boy was saved! Besides, it is my fault that he was left to cotton on of his own accord.\"\nWhy didn't you take me with you?\" I said.\n\"It would have been too suspicious to take you with me. I'm afraid I played on the bond the leader of the tribe thought existed between us.\"\n\"Are we not friends?\" I said sadly, He put an arm around my shoulder.\n\"Of course, my boy, of course. And I knew you were smart enough, and that you'd remember. One-six, six-one. You probably knew the meaning of those numbers all along.\"\n\"Did I?\"\n\"Aye. Let me ask you, what do you say was inside that chest?\"\n\"It was empty.\"\n\"Aye, but what was in it?\"\n\"The treasure?\"\n\"No, boy,\" laughed Gerundin, \"it was always empty.\"\n\"What then?\"\n\"Misdirection,\" he said, delighted with himself. I looked at the pistols as he took them from his holsters. I watched him cock the flints, undo the catches, hold them to my forehead, and pull the triggers."

I held his gaze as I spoke.\n\"We are gods.\"\nI heard the fragile echo from the loudspeaker. My voice sounded strained. Telemon grimaced. I cleared my throat before continuing.\n\"I know many of you listening, both here in Redusa and in the other great cities, have been hearing scurrilous rumours. Defamations of the worst kind...\"\nTelemon nodded encouragement. I saw now he meant to stay until the end. He didn't know I was thinking of wrecking him.\n\"...well, there is truth in those rumours.\"\nI paused for a long time. Telemon waved his hands to urge me on. Now would be the perfect moment.\n\"The truth is that.. Premier Telemon is indeed past the age of ascension. But, do not worry. No crime has been committed, no ungodly deception conveived.\"\nTelemon smiled his smug smile, I hadn't let him down. I wondered what it was that made me lie for him.

We anticipate you choosing Dawnfire as ever, and the team already set to work on the remaining parts.\nOn the matter of our Sky Hulks, they have disappointed me as much they have you.\nThe foreman tells me it has been difficult getting the necessary Galiish co-operation. Seven Gall boffins did not come to help us finish maintenance and found a few things needed adjusting, but if we'd known sooner, it would have saved a lot of trouble.\nWe're trying to ascertain the fundamentals behind these automata.

They say she is courting suitors, for she must soon sire the first of her eight daughters. Her attendants fuss about her, but she bats them away. Her long dress seems a mismatch for her skipping gait. She is smiling, she is beautiful, I can see she neither likes nor dislikes the attention, it is simply routine.

      "The Mystery of the Missing Book of Entitlement": [
        "Last year my father was fifty. Joyous at the mortal life he had led, it came time for rising. But oh how we fretted when we discovered his book of stamps was lost! lt seemed to have disappeared during the night from the chain on which he kept it. We searched our habitat high and low, but there was no sign. Not once did we think the matter could be \"criminal\".\nI recount the intrigue, because by doing so, I bring myself closer to god. You see I played a modest par in bringing the culprit to justice. Note that, since this will serve as testimony before the Overseer, I must not spare a detail, and hope not to cause offence by it.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the book's disappearance, my father applied to rise without it. The office of the Utopianist refused him, and worse, questioned his citizenship in the absence of the document! The godhands investigating the happening at first believed my father's story, but doubt crept in, despite ample proof that we, his children, were citizens. The tenets absolved the godhands from providing any further assistance, and it became clear we would have to find the book ourselves.",
        "But before we come to the investigation, I must tell you a little of my family. My father, who met my mother at the cloistrum like his other mistresses, is a good man. He looked after me from the day I was born, trading his stamps for breast milk, cradling me in his arms. Of course, the Pilipai would gather at the fringes of our life, and when father's presence was required elsewhere, they kept my tiny toes powdered.\nMy brothers fought a lot. Brother Marico was younger, Patrus older, and I found myself the go-between. would hold them apart and recite the mantras of Aetherium until their fury abated. What they fought over I don't know, since we had everything we could have wished for.\nWhen time came to school, father sent Patrus away to the academy in Momoros, deciding it would be healthier for my brothers to be kept apart. Marico remained in Agbana, attending the same academy as me, where we learned to respect each other. It was only shortly before the incident with the missing book, that Patrus decided he would return home, and being god, we freely accepted him.\nOf course, his long absence meant he was not well-known to us. It soon became apparent that Momoros had instilled in him bad habits, such as a general untidiness, laziness, and a lack of concern for his fellows. He was, as far as we were concerned, far from god. But we suffered him, as the fifth tenet goes, in order to self-improve.",
        "The only other persons of bearing on the mystery, are our family doctor, Mosphor, and our Neighbour Comernicus. Mosphor was grizzled and looked very old, though I knew him in actual fact to be several years younger than father. He had no great burden of work in Agbana, and so could often (be) found reclining in the leather chair in the hall. He would pass the time recounting the same old stories of medical successes over and over again, until he had bored himself to sleep.\nComernicus often came by too, he'd debate with the doctor, or play a few hands of the dice game. He was a young man, whose work seemed to be in the line of architecture. He was often complimentary about the modernity of our habitat, and even though the furnishings were identical to his, said he would \"much like to live in it(\",) which we always thought ungodly.\nBut, on with the investigation. Of course, we had no idea of what to do next, since no agency existed in Sabor catering for the solving of mysteries. We appealed to our friends, and one of them made an obnoxious suggestion that we at first dismissed - to receive a foreign expert in such matters.\nAs it turned out, our desperation being very great, we gave further thought to the proposition, and then acted upon it. The man in question was humble indeed, for it took many weeks correspondence back and forth between our country and the distant land they call Great Marsha to root him out. When we finally had this squat amphibian of a fellow in our net, so to speak, we brought him back to our habitat in Agbana and set him to work.",
        "Puggibun squelched up and down in gumshoes, asking this and that about our habits. His trousers were ludicrous, his smell dank, and he would occasionally let out a belch. I had mind to take him to the cloistrum and give him a good wash, but I dared not touch him for fear of disease. In spite of some quirks, his summary appeared sensible on the issue of the lost stamp book.\nlt has been stolen, by persons unknown,\" he said gravely.\nPuggibun assured us he wouldn't need a translator, but hearing this explanation, I was sure he must have made some linguistic mistake.\nStolen?\" I said, \"What sort of word is that?\"\n\"The book has been removed without permission,\" clarified the little green gentleman.\nAt this, my father and I gasped. My brothers stood to attention and began to survey the empty hall, as if the villain might still be at large.\n\"What do we do now?\" said father.\n\"I must be given time to investigate,\" said Puggibun, with a degree of impatience.",
        "Never had I felt so degraded as this. If news spread of an injustice under our roof, I worried it might have us exiled for negligence. But who could have done such a thing? My first bought was the Pilipai. Perhaps one of our earthier cousins wished to try their hand as a citizen, and stole the book in the hope of assuming my father's identity, and his stamps.\nNo my lady, I do not think that is what has happened,\" said Puggibun, \"but you are wise to mention a possible motive. Notify the authorities that they should be on the lookout for your father's stampbook, wherever it could be used.\"\nOf course, we knew this meant gossip would spread. With heavy hearts we informed the storemasters, and the gatekeepers and so forth, that they should apprehend anyone with a book of entitlement bearing my father's name. I felt tainted, disembodied.\nPuggibun went about his business largely at the scene of the incident - my father's bedchamber. Having no particular business to attend, since my assignments are light, I followed the little man everywhere pressing for answers.\nMust you follow me about?\u201c He said, tutt-tutting.\n\"What have you found?\" I asked.\n\"At this time,\" he said with a huff, \"I do not know if I have found something or nothing. If you continue to hector me, I am sure it will be the latter!\"\n\"Alright, alright,\" I said, and I sat at the end of father's bed dreaming up solutions of my own.",
        "Puggibun didn't think it was the Pilipai, so despite my reservations, I ruled them out as the suspects. My suspicions fell easily on the person I knew least well, my elder brother Patrus.\nThat he had only recently arrived home, added weight to the evidence against him. Over dinner he told father he was \"angry,\" at the way my father had treated him, by packing him off to Momoros to school. Their relationship was noticeably strained, father often storming out of the house at the tiniest provocation from Patrus.\nIn my view, father had every right to be dissapointed in his son. When he could have been training to scale the apotheon, or taking up good causes, Patrus lounged about in his nightgown. He ate, drank, and threw things and Marico while he was trying to work. It was undignified, and not the sort of example we should be setting for the Pilipai, if we want them to respect us.\n\"Do you have any notion of who it might be?\" I asked Puggibun.\n\"I am only looking for evidence. The evidence itself will tell the story,\" he said crossly, poking around in the flowerpot.",
        "I decided Patrus was far too obvious. Perhaps instead it was MArico, who so obviously wanting rid of our brother, and knowing suspicion would fall on him, could himself have stolen it. I congratulated myself on my cleverness. I had no idea that foul play could be so thrilling!\n\"Hmm,\" said Puggibun, stirring through the ash in the fireplace, then walking over to the window to breathe the city air, \"one should never guess.\"\nMaybe Marico wasn't that cruel. We are gods, after all, and must be kind and noble. Besides, I can attest to him never having had such a streak since he was a teenager when he and Patrus used to fight. Ever since he has been nothing less than a chivalrous and caring young man.\nI thought of Comernicus, and his preoccupation with the Alcoves and decor of our habitat, \"there's a lovely turn-of-the-century balance about it.\"\nPerhaps he covets it, and hopes with my father's exile the building shall become available for allocation. With his friends on the utopian committee, he will no doubt be able to swing things in his favour. IT seems preposterous, yet this theft is like a little crack in the porcelain, it makes the whole world hum as if to shatter. When you are so used to having everything, you do so long for even the smallest amount of the illlicit. But I've never known a Saborian act upon it! Who else? Doctor Mosphor? Surely not!",
        "\"Come, gather round,\" said Puggibun, who had assembled everyone, including doctor Mosphor, in the hall. Puggibun was rather enjoying the plump olives the Pilipai had set out on the table.\n\"So. I have come to some conclusion about this mystery,\" he said, chewing.\n\"Have you found the book?\" said father.\n\"Yes and no.\"\n\"Well where in Aetherium is it?\" interjected Patrus, taking a handful of olives for himself.\n\"Please,\" said Puggibun, sweeping a hand over his face testily, \"give me a moment to explain.\"\nHe began a slow walk around the room, his eyes jumping from one face to the next. Then he let out a tremendous belch.\n\"I beg your pardon!\" Comernicus said, but Puggibun cut him off.\n\"The first thing I noticed,\" he said, \"was the lack of care by which the culprit removed this book of entitlements from its chain. A person who inteded to use the book for his or herself, would also want the corner in which the chain is fastened.\"\n\"So the thief was in a hurry?\" said doctor Mosphor.\n\"Not just a thief. On this evidence alone, it is possible to call the criminal a libellist. This person wanted to bring the family name into disrepute. It is my belief the cuplrit wanted the owner of the book to lose his citizenship, suffer the shame of exile, and see his family dispersed. All this for a greater personal gain even than a book of stamps, and was the aspect of the case I found hardest to fathom.\"\n\"Are you suggesting it was one of us?\" said brother MArico. Puggibun shuffled strangely and raised an eyebrow.\n\"Absolutely. Who else? The second piece of evidence makes it certain. There was ash in the fireplace, yet we are deep in summer. Is that not a curious thing? On closer inspection of the ash, I discovered the smallest sliver of the book which matched the pieces still attached to the chain.\"\n\"Goodness!\" (S)aid doctor Mosphor again, taking his feet down from the rocking chair.",
        "No-one seemed to know what to say next. So it was me that spoke up.\n\"Everything, from the very beginning has pointed that way. There has never been any evidence of one of these 'burglurs'.\"\n\"Quite so. Which leads me to level my accusation. It has taken me some research to begin to grasp your customs in Sabor, but I feel my efforts now paid dividend.\"\nHe smiled like a frog.\n\"Who was it who stood most to lose by the book going missing? Your father, who sits here before us. Of all these other people which one of them had the greatest motive for wanting their father dispossessed of his citizenship?\"\nAll we could hear was the tot-tot-tot of the doctor pouring himself some wine.\n\"Well I'll tell you,\" he said.\n\"Wait,\" I said, \"I know who it is was, and I know why they did it.\"\n<The rest of this text is missing>"

        "It was intriguing to see so many facets of our own lives mirrored in the meanderings of this unseen community. Of course, the lives of the ants seemed a lot less pleasurable than our own. A blue lizard appeared, for example, and ate several ants with a single flick of tongue. The hive turned on the lizard, and managed to drive him away, swarming over him, and biting through his loose and wrinkled skin.\nThis is exactly the kind of example we provide to the schools,\" Pater continued. \"The lesson you should learn from today, is that no matter your prior experience, there is a project to reach out to you, and consume you.\"\nI was rather taken with the ants, myself. in them I saw the things I had craved from a military career. A sense of purpose, of belonging, and of good organisation. But then I also came to see things I was glad to have passed up. None of the ants had any steer to their own beyond immediate threats to the wellbeing of their nest. I imagined soldiery to be similar. Although presently there was little to occupy our armies, who could say what the future held?"

        "I started working on weapons around the same time Telemon and I used to meet at Mollin's cafe. Our academy days were behind us, but we were still friends. We'd lunch high over the Redu delta, watching a thousand small brown bodies navigating the water channels in their gondolas, and like a mirror image, the river of skyships above. When he arrived, Telemon always looked out and said \"We are god, and these are my people\", then we would both laugh.\nI remember the spectacular glass floor, and the otherworldy cuisine. At night, they held dances, and the skyships and boats were like candles all around. Molin used to come out and greet us, and he was especially fond of Telemon. They remain firm friends to this day, each so driven by their art, that life and family were left behind. Molin was old then, so is ancient now, Telemon's private chef and casual advisor.\nThe cafe's still up there, but I haven't been back. I won't watch the delta fold into the earth from up in the city. I prefer to be down here, amoung our Foundations, so when the big one comes I can be the first to go. We are far from god now, if ever were near.",
        "Telemon was a junior of the Assembly back then, but an idealist, and I thought it would take him far. I was his oldest friend, and he expected to make few others, in politics at least, saying his best chance was to thin out his enemies until he could pick off the few that were left. Even so, I think I misjudged how ruthless he could be.\nWe both used to sit there at Molin's, drinking vittles, committing heresy. It isn't on to brag in Sabor, you know, but we slipped our advancements and successes under out napkins like spies. Telemon was interested when I told him more about the weapons. At the time they were prototypes, abstracts. I said I was worried about how much Atlas they would use. Telemon agreed it was a risk, after all, the Atlas states had voted against them, two centuries before.\nMaviana helps me by winding the torch. The whirr, then the light faded up, until it is bright enough to reflect in the water below. She attaches the torch to the rope on the pulley, and the beam steadies. We see that more rock has fallen, and made islands in the pool like gritty porridge. There is a dull greening - little pinheads of light from the Atlas. We begin our descent.\nMy family tell me I'm old enough for the rising place now, but I won't go. Damn them for suggesting it! I've not done enough to join an Aetherium - if one exists. I'm as mortal as they come, and much the better for it.\nThe best I can hope for, is that when my time comes, I can learn to forgive myself. Thirty years ago I helped build those weapons and wheeled them in frot of the Redusa assembly. I was just doing my bit, I was helping begin our end.",
        "We all knew things were changing, and when it was proposed at the Assembly, the question of our duty to preserve was choked. I remember when we lived in harmony with the land, when we lived in harmony with its caretakers, the Pilipai. That was a golden age, but ages pass, busts on pedestals come toppling down.\nThe delta is drained, the animal bodies litter the empty runnels where water once gushed. That is not perfection. We cannot simply ascend into the clouds, up and up. Telemon says gods are \"unbound from the chains of the earth'. Yet there are chains aplenty - long lines of chains that bind the men, women and children of Darat to the mines, day and night scratching for stone, with nothing to look forward to but an early death.\nBack then, I was so angry, I went to see him in person at the Committee office. I remember the skyship dropping down between the glimmering masts of the Stalk, and that I couldn't wait to get at his throat. I stormed in, bust the white door wide open, and Telemon just laughed.\n\"It's done now, isn't it?\" he said.\n\"It is slavery Telemon!\"\n\"We must preserve the cities. Nothing else matters.\"",
        "Much of my rage faded at that moment, and sadness slopped in. All the time I had spend with Telemon felt wasted, and our friendship failed. The man was grotesque, his godhands brutal, his propaganda copius. Then I reflected on what I had done. For the first time I felt responsible. War would come, and my weapons would take lives.\nSo it has come to pass - war with the Unity, and every day the ground shakes. We citizens are so naive: we've never seen military operations, we've no notion of the killing, and yet we take personal credit for each report of victory. What teaches us? It is the parades of Essedari, the precision ceremonial drills. The spoils of war triumphantly draped from our ships, the women and men of the Assembly stooping through the garlands, and fighting puffs of confetti. Presentations by eager children to the girm-faces servicemen who've come back heroes. It is even the pageant celebrating the ascent of those that never came back that feeds our ego.",
        "Telemon just spoke over the radio. He said war was inevitable, and that Sabor must be preserved.\n\"...We are the envy of the world, we cannot fall...the Saborian way, is the only way. We are gods.\"\nThe assembly, strongarmed by Bulgus and his godhands, will agree, and the war will go on. Bulgus is vindicated now Kioki have rejected peace, and he has Telemon's full support.\nThe dream of how things once were clings to us like film. We will not relinquish the past if we still think we live in it. I hope somewhere inside Telemon is hurting, and that I have made him hurt. I look at Maviana and she looks back at me. She's afraid.

        "Many years passed and the Empress grew into a beautiful young woman. Alas her father did not live nearly as long. Three months after she had strayed from the palace, he fell ill and died in his sleep. With no firm hand to guide her, the Empress, who was a difficult child, became a yet more difficult adult.\nGetta Renata would oft leave the court, something her guardians had forbidden, and wander the the streets of Ten-Rui. The people would always remember the little girl with the brown smock, and took fondly to her. She was flighty and hard to please, she asked questions and never waited for the answers, but none could deny that she was wise and king, and had some special quality.\nShe always took time to visit the kindly tailor, and thank him for the smock he had given her. The tailor always offered her one of his beautiful dresses, and she always declined. As she grew, she asked him to adjust the smock so that it still fit her - but her guardians only ever allowed her to wear it in private. One day she visited his shop, only to find that it was closed and emptied. The tailor was sat on the doorstep crying.\n\"Oh poor Mr. Tailor\" she said, \"What has happened?\"\n\"I have been evicted by the squire, and dispossessed of my wares,\" he said.\n\"Oh how terrible,\" said the Empress, \"I will see to it that you are restored.\"\n",
        "Nevertheless the counsel of the purse insisted the young courtier disguised as the Empress continue to visit the low-town, just as Getta had done, so that no suspicions would be aroused. The courtier quickly discovered that the mood of the people had changed. The Empress, whom as a child in a brown smock they had so dearly loved, appeared to have betrayed them.\nNo sooner had the courtier, disguised in the Empress' beautiful green dress, entered the market square, than barrels were tipped, and rotten fruit thrown in her direction. Others took handfuls of mud and smeared her where she stood. The sparrow guard rushed to her defence, impaling the culprits with their spears, but the damage was already done. The mob now turned upon the guards, and the courtier was able to escape into a backstreet.",
        "Remarkably, the kindly tailor took her measurements, and found them to be exactly as they had always been. He took her instructions patiently, making all the arrangements she had asked for. When the courtier has exhasted him, and night was soon to fall, she turned her back on him and marched to the door to leave. \n\"Please wait your highness, for there is one more dress in my shop,\" he said, and he took a plain brown smock from the top of his work table and held it before her. \n\"Do you mock me sir?\" she said, \"that is not fit for an Empress, and is presently much too large.\" \n\"Very well,\" he said, smiling sadly. \nBut before she could step through the door to rejoin the sparrow guard, the tailor had a hold of her neck, and his sharpest needle over the ball of her eye.\n\n\"Where is the true Empress? I shall not make clothes for an impostor.\" \nShocked and afraid for her life, the young courtier spilled all she could about the great dog and the green islands, and vowed not to speak of his assault should he let her safely go. That he did, and the courtier ran off into the night, never to be seen again.\n\nThe next day, on the tailor's advice, the angry populace stormed the court and commandeered it for themselves. Though once they were there, they lacked the wherewithal to use their power. Meanwhile, the kindly tailor chartered a galleon in exchange for the gold he had been given for his clothes, and with his crew, set sail for the green islands.",
        "When he arrived there, he immediately came upon the great dog, whose fur was also green, A hapless sailor tried to attack the dog with his cutlass, but the dog brushed him aside with a lazy paw, and he was dashed upon some rocks.\nThen the great dog spake.\n\"I know why you have come.\"\n\"I came because I must,\" replied the kindly tailor, \"for I made a solemn promise.\"\n\"Then I shall not stand in your way, provided you can answer three questions,\" the great dog boomed. \n\"Very well,\" said the tailor, who was determined in spite of his fear. \n\"One. What is your profession?\"\n\"I am a poor tailor, with not a penny to my name,\" he said, and he spake the truth, for he'd spent the last of his gold on chartering the galleon. \n\"Good,\" said the dog, chewing on a sailor's bones, \n\"Second. Who is it you seek?\" \n\"I seek the Empress of Ten-Rui, who has been imprisoned here against her will. She is a noble creature, yet she kind enough to pity the weak. Oh great dog, can you not learn to pity the weak too?\" \n\"I can,\" said the great dog, licking the blood from its paws. Then the dog asked the last of its questions, \n\"Third. What is the real reason for seeking the Empress? Do you hope for some personal gain in this business?\" \n\"Yes I do,\" said the tailor honestly, \"for though my promise was enough to bring me to these strange islands, I realise I love the Empress, and wish her to be my wife.\" \n\"Good,\" said the dog, \"then you may have her.\" \nWith that the dog opened the Empress' cage, and she fell into the kindly tailor's arms. The dog let the happy couple depart, though he gobbled a couple more sailors by way of reward.\n"

        "Theatre Review from the publication, \"Hedonist - The Magazine for Mellifluan Fetishists\"\n\nThe festival at Kubo is now concluded, and l have to say, it was a thoroughly dismal trip. Mellifluan theatre is really the most tedious, gaseous and laboured of all art forms. The fact that these performers are paid in currency for their shambolic attempts at replicating the dreary everyday miseries of Mellifluans rankles as much as anything else. Not to mention the suffocating ubiquity of those wretched beetle-blood loin cloths they drape everywhere. Every set design seems to be the same; mountains and mountains of that stupefying cloth.\n\nIn fact the only thing I can recommend that isn't bettered in our own productions is the curious use of animals. There was one particular play in which this produced some\nvery entertaining moments. Yes, \"Mo\" as he is known by the crowds, is a donkey with the most remarkable stage presence.\n\nThey say it's more the things he doesn't do, than the things he does. His performances were just so effortless, so natural. You may not be familiar with \"Rethinga,\" the classic Melliflaun drama, but the original play casts a horse in the role. l'm not sure if they were short of horses, but l'm of the opinion that the donkey was a better casting decision. Frankly the whole point is that the Queen's chosen lover is more modest and humble than the other suitors, so where a horse might seem a little aloof, a donkey is perfect.\n\n\nThe depravity of the Mellifluans knows no bounds, but suffice to say this donkey \"Mo\" put a lot of relish into the wedding scenes, and it paid off handsomely. Rightly or wrongly the scene had the audience in fits."

      "Trade Bourse": [
        "REPORT: To the Stalk Committee, Qang 2797.\nSUBJECT: Visit to the Ten-Rui Trade Bourse.\nDEFINITION: The Kioki Bourse in Ten-Rui is an exchange system for stock. People of all hues gather to barter upon the rise and fall of individual commodities, or groups of them.\nDESCRIPTION: The Bourse is situated within the grand gardens of the Empress' palace, not far from the private school known as \"The Crested Ptarmigan\". These schoolchildren will grow up to become the Nabobs and Merchants that swell the halls of the Bourse, members of trade societies that revel in wine, bloating their bodies beyond imagination.\nPersonal permission from long-serving Empress Melina is required to become a stockholder or broker. To my astonishment, I, a Saborian, was perfectly able to obtain this, needing only to raise an initial sum of capital (which I generated by trading the Saborian produce kindly donated for this experiment). I was reliably informed that there are pure-blood Ishgiruans who are denied such a right, only because they cannot afford it! Such an arbitrary entry condition means that there is no guarantee of noble character among traders...",
        "It was stuffed full, the Bourse. Yet it is my opinion that the betting (essentially an accepted system of gambles. While the average lshgiruan will bet on the stilt races, they aren't as familiar with the potential of the Bourse) is heavily weighted in favour of those that already have wealth to begin with. This is only exaggerated by the meddling of its arbiters - the so-called Mercantile Authority - who seem to pass information to their favourites in advance of shifts in the market.\nOnce the bidding commenced for the day, there was a tumultuous conflux of screaming traders. very rough indeed, and I was unable to place any bids at all. Such a system encourages the weak of body to become disillusioned. Imagine how our half-aetherials would fit into such a system. I think of my sister, who is deaf. This \"system\" of shouting and pushing does not accommodate her.\nFINDINGS: The Bourse is a layer of greed atop a layer of greed. It serves only to stratify their society further. such a system is in complete conflict with our ideals, and would by its very existence and use of currency, create poverty and inequality. Theirs is a society that is driven by nothing but the pursuit of wealth. If we wish to preserve our godhood, we must ignore shallow ways. These lshgiruans are not gods, they are mortals whose hands and souls are corroded by metal."

Bandinian serfs can be seen in every part of Redusa, chamferimg and chiselling the stone, which comes in by ship at the harbour. We have all heard tell of the watchman, a gigantic stattue straddling the harbour gate. Sadly these reports are exaggerated, since not only has the greater part of its body long since sunk beneath the waves, leaving only two leg stumps, but sandstorms from the south have worn away any painted detail. While lush and overflowing with life, Sabor is burning hot.",
        "After a long sea voyage we needed rest, and as it turned out, we were hospitably received. A mesmerising pair - a female, with a tall and lithe body, and a man whose biceps were bursting - sliced open the skin of a spotted wild-cat, which had been filled to bloating with wine, and I was given a small noggin with which to scoop my share. The dainty sweetmeats that followed were a triumph, though the Saborians themselved did not partake, for they take immense pride in the physical perfection of their bodies. Some underhand jokes were made vis-avis our \"chubiness\" in comparison to most of the Saborians, to whom vanity is no crime. Nevertheless, it meant we as well fed as any at the palace, since the thought that we might be in any way dissatisfied was terrifying to them. Our first night we found the bed linens to be feather-stuffed, just as at home, and the translator expressed how greatly the Saborians wanted us to feel welcome. We were offered bedside companions, and many of us took them.",
        "The second day, it was too hot to be outside. We stayed in the cool and angular tower, and were regaled with tales of the hunt by a wise-speaker. He conjured images of great beasts and creatures lurking above and below ground. Ants the size of foxes who live only in darkness, a horse that peeled to life from the trunk of an ancient tree. But foremost, was the story of Minuras of Conos. No sooner had the wise-speaker begun it, than the Saborians became quiet and attentive.\nLong ago there was a terror know as the Windebeast, a spirit born entirely of cloud. The Windebeast terrorised the delta, and many innocents died in its stormy grasp. Minuras of Conos bravely decided he must slay it. He undertook the journey north to the Mount of Plenty, where it had its lair. He had heard that lightning would erupt from the Windebeast's fingers, and decided he must either be so fast as to dodge them, or else so well-protected as to endure them. Not being known for his speed, Minuras fashioned a gigantic shield twice his height and width, behind which he could conceal himself. On entering the cave, the Windebeast poured all its might into the storm, and even Minuras' clever shield was not enough to deflect the jolt. They say Minuras was found three days later, burned as if he had been on fire, but still alive. Minuras was pronounced a god himself, for in the effort to kill him, the Windebeast had fractured into a thousand eddies. I am told the plateau of the Mount of Plenty still whistles with its voice.\nThese sorts of stories continued throughout the day, as we enjoyed dried but succulent fruits.",
        "As night came, and the day's warmth remained, great leafy fans wafted cool air upon our party, and their was music, and a display of nude dancing by athletic girls and boys. Demeron was delirious with the wine and gaiety, and tried to join in. Our hosts took great offense, halting the performance directly and instructing guards to chaperon Demeron outside. Thereupon he was held at spear-point until we had muddled an apology. The embarrassing incident hung over us the following morning, and it seemed proper to escape the awkwardness of the palace.",
        "We took a trip out along the river Saba toward the grand delta, where its tributaries fan out like palm fronds, easing toward the sea. This bay of north-west Sabor curves like a blade, or the new moon, and they call it \"the perfect crescent\", because its people have everything they desire.\nOur vessel was fine and stately. The sun beamed and shone, but a breeze took the edge off the heat. Small boats, filled with chickens, goats, fisherfolk, and ferrymen, ran us by. Tombs and temples, in varying states of disrepair, specked the river banks, and we'd stop off at as many as could. Some contained undecipherable writings, and painted casks filled with the possessions of the dead. The Saborians claim that they were among the first civilisations, and heaving cruised along their delta, I have no reason to doubt it. These constructions appear very old indeed. I saw for example, an obelisk commemorating a general at a battle waged long before the Bandinian war, itself nearly a thousand years ago."

We took our ship Redusa at a run towards the godforsaken cove, and huddled in their(our?) long lined coats, but it was scarcely enough to dissuade the wind and the spittle of the sea from biting.\n\"Beautiful Sabor, will we ever see her again, the crescent of her bounty?\" said the bo'son.\n\"There's nothing to keep us here, let us turn back,\" said another.\n\"Please captain, let us. It is plain from the jaggedy rocks, and the fickle wind that there is nothing for us here.\"\n\"We must stay true to our quest, and buck this homesickness like a yak its fleas,\" I said as boldly as I could, yet at heart I was with my companions.",

Their houses were elegant, though too strange to afford us comfort. A local woman saw that we were soldiers, and gestured for us to lay down our weapons. Their faces were pale, and their eyes slender and curved.\nHer husband, emerging from their dwelling and passing an infant to his wife (They had agreed to suffer each other's comapny for life), knew us to be Saborian, and began to practice his illiterate version of our language without any invitation.

Indeed, their ritual only occurs (if you exclude the mid bath-houses and attendances at public theatre, which are always conducted nude) once a year.\nThis is event is festival week, held in honour of the Ice God. Though the exact date varies, it is always held around the summer equinox, where there is almost no darkness at all. Nudity is both more comfortable on hot summer days, and apart from anything else, is an outward celebration of freedom, not some insular perversion. It is this principal that has won me over.\nThere is nothing strange about obsession with the body. After all, we have a strange relationship with it, do we not? It is definitively ours to own, yet we are not always fully in possession of it. That the sculptures, flags and motifs of the Verdubans are adorned with its components is representative of the importance of it to them.

Our near neighbours the Verdubans, however peculiar them may seem, are often the most outspoken and committed to relieving the world of injustice.

While it is less in our nature to fight for lost causes, we must keep our own waters and grassy bogs clean.\"\nBAWN's banners are covered in slogans such as \"Stop mining Atlas, stop the war!\" are are using out-of-date Panyana research to back their claims. The paper to which their campaign frequently refers is an old one - drafted by Alcibiana of all people - and has generated an abundance of similar, but according to BAWN, \"overlooked\" papers in the three and three-quarter centuries since. A reduction of Atlas mining and use would need both Kioki and Sabor to back, not to mention the rest of Foundation, a situation which looks increasingly unlikely."

Every day a Saborian took several small leaps, drawing them closer and closer to god.\n\nToday the Committee would be discussing the gem-combing wastrels of the studded desert, and the Pillipai who were protesting in Conos over their unfair treatment. None of the cities were accepting new citizenships, and the godhands, unsupervised and lawless, had grown violent beyond the walls.\n\nThe godhands had been taught how to use force, that is how these things start. Unless the Pillipai were put under pressure. how else could there be enough fuel and food for the four cities?\n"

        "We are the Krakenites. We don the mask and body of the Kraken. You may have seen our mission pamplets in your area. If you are baffled, then let us reiterate; The world would not be the same without Krakens.\nPerhaps you think a baby Kraken is an easy target for food or sport, as it wallows in our estuaries, and that we should just let nature take its course and allow their species to die out. While a full grown adult is the most fearsome creature in Foundation, Kraken babies are a failure of evolution, a harmless thing to be preyed upon by human and animal predators alike.\nBut it is this attitude that almost caused Krakens to become extinct two-hundred years ago. Since then, the Krakenites of the Great Marshas have gathered with the unremitting intention of keeping these wonderful creatures alive. \nIt is not \"natural selection\" that defines the continued existence of the Kraken, but the \"unnatural selection\" imposed by our changes to their enviroment, our hunting of them, the vast number of ships in the seas and skies, water pollution, changes to the climate caused by our guzzling of Atlas.\n",
        "Alright, there aren't many left, and they have problems breeding. Their almost singular food source, plankton, is ever more scarce since the quakes began. They have digestive problems that lead to poor health; and because they are secretive and live in the deepest abyssal ocean, trying to understand they way they live is a complex challenge.\nIf the Kraken were beautiful, really beautiful, then non-Krakenites might care more for their wellbeing. But because they are not - 'though of course we Krakenites love then - the arguments for their preservation remain all the stronger.\nThe removal of any species, big or minute, foul or fair, has dramatic consequences for those that remain - soon we will be saying the same thing about the Thuntomite, or long-necks. When the beasts of our world die, we humans will be left in an empty Foundation, friendless and lost. We will suffer intolerable loneliness and displacement. All things are one - and whatever fate befalls the kraken, will soon befall us.\nMortin Granvik\nThe Krakenites"

      "Worlds Aft - By Tomalayo": [
        "I scratch this dark wall panel with a piece of Atlas (call it a lucky charm). Jaz, who is a ruffian, finds this odd, but is happy to see a fool like me occupied and out of the way, and while it hurts to commit our recent history here, I feel there is no other place to begin.\nIf you are reading this now, I am delighted for you. Firstly, because you can clearly still read, and have therefore been schooled formally or informally. Secondly, because you are about to revel in our terrible past, all its happenings and disasters, without ever having to experience the horror firsthand. I hope you find some way of appreciating your good fortune in that regard.\n Our waterways became our skyways, and our ships, skyships. In many ways we are the same people we were thousands of years ago. Then Atlas happened, and many said it was a terrible thing. I tend to disagree, I say we ourselves are to blame, but I am hardly surprised that's what they said. Atlas was, after all, the beginning of the end for the old world.",
        "Ah, the old world - it seems strange to baptise it thus. Though it has been months, it feels a matter of hours since Foundation was below us, all around us. The seething stinkpots that were Darat and Drissa, the sweet smell of Mellifluan goat musk, children playing by the impossible fountains of Ten-Rui. I wonder if those fountains are still out there somewhere, who knows?\nI should say, as I chew on its softened blubber, that we didn't go hunting for the skywhale. It just happened out of the clouds and nearly split the deck in two. ITs slimeshell weeped blackly right where the harpoon pierced it. Jaz says it was only young. He is a canny lad, and always has a harpoon ready. Sometimes, I wonder if he needs to clean and oil it as much as he does, but what do I know?",
        "I long for a mug of good hot vittle, not this slop we have. I only visited the Korchis mountains once, but they brewed it so well. Chado nut-vittles, sweet yet bitter, dark and indulgent. Smokiness too. But heavens, i must stop drooling.\nJaz came in, but he's gone now. He was gruff with me, when they're like that i feel so alone. These aren't really my people, but what can i do? i hope they can't read what I've written, it might make things worse. I've had some bad moments, and Jaz is the only one speaking to me;\n\"I said, \"Jaz, what have i done?\"\n\"He said, \"You're too noisy.\u201c\n\"Anything else?\"\n\"You eat too much.\"\n\"But we've a whole whale strapped across deck, and the ship struggles to stay afloat!\"\n\"We might never snare another,\" he said.\nI think I'm beginning to get it. It's not because I overeat, or am too noisy. It's not the difference in status between us - which has no significance in the frame of this new world. It is that they ear death, and I do not. They merely want to survive, but I want to live. Give me pleasure, let me love and let me dance! Though I have no legs, I still have feeling in my two arms. Let us not drift in this black turmoil having no fun at all!",
        "The storms are terrible, and we are trapped down in the hold, where the stench of whale oil makes me gag. I'm feeling well enough to write, since the others keep our spirits up. Jaz and Nomusa had a good laugh at my Pinnish hat, and I laughed along too. They were being cruel, but at least they are no longer ignoring me.\nI had no choice when it came to a ship. Ten-Rui was chaos when the rumbles burst the earth, and we pushed and shoved our way to the pierpoints like a warlock's rats (Oh, how I long to have the space and legs to run again). I took refuge in the first skyship I could, this tiny but robust wonder on which we now drift.\nThe captain, Joson, immediately complained of my presence. Joson said I was, \"the kind of useless buffoon that got us into this mess\". I panicked and said I would make a fine addition to their crew, being a respected aviation scholar, and that they would be wise to extend an expert pilot a welcoming hand.\nThen Joson and Jaz had a discussion in Pin, a language i do not profess to understand - something about a debt. As the skyship made away, the pair decided to continue this discussion above deck. An hour passed, after which only Jaz returned. l think Joson may somehow have perished, but Jaz has not spoken of it since.",
        "My lies caught up with me. When pressed by Jaz, who it seems has now inherited the captaincy, I was forced to admit that my competence in practical aviation was rather overshadowed by my knowledge of historic naval battles, specifically the feats of commander Alkabar of the Bandini. Jaz's disappointment manifested suddenly and painfully with a bop to my nose.\nJaz's fury cooled, and my nose recovered. I had hoped that with my secret out, they might come to accept me for who I was. As it is, we've traveled together for some time since, enduring many hardships, and yet I still feel that unless I find a way of contributing substantially, I shall suffer the same fate as poor Joson.",
        "Without the use of my legs, I despair. I have lost track of what's happening outside; all I need remember is that it is a place of darkness and violence. I feel discouraged by the way things have gone. Preserve, destroy, create, the Mellifluans call this chaos \"limbo\". Whatever it is, our tiny craft is at its mercy.\nMy perception of time seems to have inverted. I once heard a story about the Mellifluan many-gendered god Baliandri. The Mellifluans say Baliandri straddles the great beetle Motus, who faces the future, and puts his abdomen to the past. As mortals, we are the opposite. We do not know what lies ahead, we can only know what has been and gone.\nMy own past is like the foreboding entrance to a hedge maze. Its entrance pillars are aflame, and fire convulses over the threshold. Rajas circle ominously, waiting to strike. But courage flushes me, for I know what lies at the centre of the maze. A beautiful ornament. It is the eternal spring of life. A memory of the old world, and my sole companion in this, the new.",
        "The sky seems lighter today.\nJaz just came in, and he thinks I might finally be of some use to them. We have discovered land - I can see it through a porthole. There is a beautiful copse of autumnal trees, like a tine piece of Karem floating on air. Nomusa, it seems, is nervous about what we might find. Being the most \"widely-traveled\" of the group, he hopes I can provide some sort of insight where they cannot.\n\"Well perhaps we can find fresh water there?\" I say.\n\"We have the rain-collector, we don't need water,\" Nomusa replies like a dictator. You know the type, one minute they look like they want to throw you overboard, the next you feel trapped.\n\"But I haven't had a good long slug in two years!\" I say. You see, we only ever collect enough to get by.\n\"Fine, but food is more important. Don't go roving about, old man.\"\nNomusa is something of a navigator, and as long as the ship can be safely maneuvered, he is content. He obsesses over the ship, and we are all glad of that, but there's no enthusiasm saved for anything else. I have on many occasions, tried to stir up memories of their old lives and to hear their stories, but it is as though they have already forgotten them. Is it that these present hardships are no worse than the lives they already knew?",
        "We thought the terrors had passed, and perhaps they have.\nBut foreboding omens still remain. I woke sharply around midnight. The ship was dark, but I heard a commotion up on deck. Jaz swayed as he held a lantern and yelled into the storm. The portholes swung open and shut on their hinges.\nMy senses did not quicken to the trouble until I looked to the cloud. It plumed to the heavens like a great green bust. From beyond it came a dark speck; a ship, and lightning flanked her, as she sailed towards us. Jaz managed to get a burst from the engines, and we pillowed upward, no longer obstructing her path, as she skirred mournfully, and in silence, beneath us. Something about the galleon caught in my throat. I threw myself up the forecastle stairs, and clawed open the door into the howl, before knuckling across the deck on my stumps, hoping to catch another glimpse.\nSure enough she loomed up; her blackened hull and rotten sails. No crew could have lifted such a curse as she'd invoked. Her twisted bony beams, creaking and straining. Swirls of darkness in her wake, like the bloom of poison ink. Then the ship folded in on itself before my very eyes. Vanished, I swear. I'd say she was a dream, or mirage, but for the sickly smog of snuffed incense that lingered long after.",
        "Together, we survived another attack. I am told it was the helmsman's fault, and that out of curiosity he had steered us towards a flight of birds. Drawing near, we saw not birds, but beetles. Their vibrant elytra were a warning, like Godhand livery at the gates of Momoros. they hubbubbed and flickered at us, and we were obliged to beat them away with sticks, until we could manoeuvre clear.\nIf only, in those first few days, we'd been able to outrun the Gizzard so easily, I'd still have me legs. Those brigands toyed with me as I hung from the mizzenmast. All my juices drained into my stockings, and the days came in and out of view with thirst. It was not before time that Jaz broke us free, and singing an old warlock's song, set the knaves asleep. He took possession of their engines, and left them to drift, and we were all the better for it. My legs suffered some horrible putrefaction, and heavily medicated, Nomusa swiped them off with a blade. I suppose the misfortune of losing my legs is offset against the good fortune of still being alive. Gods bless Jaz and his crew for their resourcefulness, I hope I can repay them.",
        "I sat with Jaz and the others at the captain's table. We had some good crab. I have now been given an official title - I shall be Bo'son. I believe, however, that this is wit on the part of my fellow skyfarers, given that no such position is required on a ship without sails. Still it is their way of including me, and I am glad. Imagine two bulls, churning the mud. They fight at the expense of all else, eyes crazed, their bodies rent and broken. Yet they are perfectly matched, and neither will back down over the heifer they most desire. That is how it was at the end. That is how the Foundation fell.",
        "lf you want to lay blame at a door, it must be at Sabor's. I remember Redusa before the end of the second millennium, it was dazzling, perfect, untroubled. But as the floor rocked, others were made to suffer to keep that bubble from bursting. They wanted Atlas, but from where? First Bandinia, then Melliflua. If the Saborians had known the way it would end, would they have stopped sooner, before it was too late? How a peoples can be both so selfless and so selfish, we may never know.\nBut my people played their part, there's no doubt. They had peace, but wouldn't take it. The Empress was rational in her madness, and at her shoulder, was Gloam, mad in his rationale.",
        "I hereby ascribe the year I commenced writing these histories the \"new days\". We begin, not at the old beginning, but the new one. A new beginning.\nToday is the first day the skies have been clear in seven years. We hoped and hoped, and now we rejoice. That terrible empurpled hole, the belly of a beast, is satisfied, and the creature retires to its cave to brood.\nI am on the lower deck, and am blissfully nibbling chunks of stewed skywhale. It is from here that I can look comfortably out throught the portholes of this heroic ship. Oh how I love it! How I love its crew tenderly. This is a love expressed by our very survival, by us withstanding so many tribulations. Yet here we all still are, and as I watch pink clouds wisp by, I take pleasure in every second, that I, Tomalayo, am able to continue my life.\nI have finally gotten hold of pen and linen! Not since my days at the court! In time I hope to transfer these ramblings from the wall, for whomever might find them - to be kept in a museum perhaps, when the new days rebuild us. But every minute, every hour, every day, takes us further away from what we were. Like a boat heading out to sea, we might one day look back, and seeing no shoreline, forget ourselves. I feel it is my duty, in these notes, to recount the world as it once was.",
        "You know, these whales are strange, but they don't scare me. Dad used to trap them when I was a boy, before we moved away from Tarrery. Very cold, was Tarrery, and yet we never wore many clothes! No, these whales don't scare me. Not if you know how it was in Ten-Rui when the towers fell.\nIf I squint at this beautiful sunset - a forgotten pleasure - do not take it for granted! - then I still see its black silhouette. The spry, arched back. The weave of arcane sinew. A barnacled hoop of encrustation, and the very same the Pekoe said would come. Hatep, come to gather his children. A demon or a god, I'm sure of it. Jaz denies these memories exist. He says we saw many queer things, and have no marker for what was and wasn't real.",
        "He brings me a jug of water. A whole jug! Jaz is smiling. Through a porthole, I can see the ripple of the lake from which it was drawn. Nomusa meanwhile, has been lancing crustacea all day. He prowls, and I can see him asking the others to get back aboard in order for us to leave. Now I'm not for a moment suggesting we spend our whole lives on this tiny isle, but can we at least investigate a little? If they could lift me, I could move around on my hands and stumps. Looking for some good bits of pegwood to remedy my situation.",
        "They say Telemon had no friends, but nor did he have enemies. His charm and bluster saw to that. I heard, whenever the Assembly met at the Stalk, he threw lavish suppers garnished with gold leaf and powdered Atlas. What an ungodly hypocrite, but the wheels were slipping by then. Near the end, it was rumoured he had a tumpkin like a ship's hull, and had lost all the hair on his head. Of course he couldn't let them see him like that. The public speeches had to stop, and he spoke over the radio instead.",
        "Many islands we've encountered have been green, but drearily small and unremarkable. The latest, however, was different. I found a largely intact ruin of Panyana University. The cobbles and the arches mind, no books, no students.\nI've no doubt they thought it'd last forever. Maybe it will in some form. But they can't have imagined vines creeping the pews, and lectures led by beetles and flies. Time and nature persist even if we are broken. Us, scattered like fragments of a jar, whose oil has spilled through cracks in the floor.\nThe Gall were the subtle menace, like a leaf blowing in the wind, to whichever oppurtunity paid dividend. It is unfortunate no-one could decrypt their Rebus, else the black isle might have fallen, and the full catalogue of their knowledge have been freely available to all. Or would that have made things worse? I don't suppose it matters anymore.",
        "If you are reading this, perhaps I have found a wife, and you are my kin. Foundation is no more, yet this skyblown archipelago demands a fresh start of us. There are few of us left, and we must endeavour to bring it dignity.\nI am laying my pen to rest, for there is work to be done. I am helping to build a small fixed house, where myself, Jaz and Nomusa can live. Yes, I know, unlikely bedfellows we may seem, but I have garnered some respect when it comes to practical things.\nI tire of the endless search, and wish to take to the air when I please, not by necessity. We have found a large and fine island. Let us hope no other terrors await us there.We men shall then raise a great beacon, like mythical sirens, so that passing beauties can be lured into our trap."
